<p>
Doubtless it will seem strange to most men,
that after 30 years not unsuccessful practice
in this great City, I should now at
last forbear sending my Bills to the <i>Apothecaries</i>,
knowing that hereby a whole
Company of men interested in the World (who by
their number, noise, and tricks, may be able to decry
any <i>Physician</i>) will become my implacable adversaries,
and by their private whispers of untrue tales, will endeavour
to their utmost, either to keep me from any
new, or shuffle me out of my fixed imployment. But
not fearing the utmost their malice can invent, or proclaim;
I shall publickly assert what I privately practice,
preferring the publick good, and the honour of
my profession before my own private profit. And although
I have had some experience what their
groundless anger can do, when they some years since
proclaimed me in their publick Hall their Enemy, for

<a class="pb" name="6" id="png004"></a>

acting the <i>College</i> Interest, and of late for saving my
Patients lives and purses, by dispencing <i>gratis</i> my Medicines.
Yet I hope no indifferent person, when he
knows that I have thus long slighted their weak endeavours,
will believe I can now at length have so poor an
end as revenge; especially when they shall consider
on the one hand, the universal and daily complaints
of both <i>Patient</i> and <i>Physician</i>, the great cause they
have to do so, and the little hope of a remedy, and
on the other, besides that general obligation all men
have of doing their Country-men good, and the particular
necessity I have of justifying my actions, by
leaving the World their judg upon the account I
shall here deliver of them. And lastly, that which will
leave my Enemies not any objection, I take upon me
not only a great trouble, but charge, without any
other design then doing mankind good, by endeavouring
to restore my profession to its ancient and deserved
honours. And had I none of these inducements, I am
sure the vulgar excuse of friends importunities may be
satisfactory to all persons for my publishing what I here
do, when I must acknowledge that many of my Collegues
and other Practisers in several parts, upon reading
these papers furnished me not only with some bad
practices of their own experience, but thereupon enjoyed
the publishing of them. So that in these papers
I do but speak the common language of all <i>Physicians</i>,
and of very many <i>Patients</i>. Neither are all their frauds
and abuses here inserted, the rest (perhaps more in
number) being reserved to another opportunity.  I
shall only add by way of preface; that the last year a
Book was printed on the same argument, by an inquisitive

<a class="pb" name="7" id="png005"></a>

person, now <i>Dr.</i> in <i>Physic</i>, which might have
spared me this labour, but that it was too large for every
ones reading, and in some things short. It was his
fate to be called by them <i>Fool</i>, <i>Ass</i>, and <i>Simple Fellow</i>,
and much worse language, bragging that some of their
<i>Boys</i> should answer him. But upon more serious
thoughts, the whole Company have suffered it to find
the credit it well deserves, without the least reply but
that of revilings.
</p>

<p>
In these ensuing papers, I hope to prove, that these
abuses complain'd of by all sorts of persons, arise from
this only cause, that <i>Physicians</i> dispence not themselves
such Medicines, they use for the relief of their <i>Patients</i>,
but commit this work to the <i>Apothecaries</i>, or rather
their Servants.
</p>

<p>
Now the <i>Apothecaries</i> abuses generally relate either
to the <i>Medicines</i>, <i>Patients</i>, or <i>Physicians</i>; which three
do comprehend all I shall say on this subject.
</p>

<p>
But the Reader is to take notice, that all here
charged on the <i>Apothecaries</i>, is not meant of every single
one, but of some, or more of them, and may in a
short time in all probability be verified of them all,
according as their number, cajoling the ignorant, and
bold daring in <i>Physic</i> increase.
</p>

<p>
But before I descend to particulars, I shall first lay
down this <i>Proposition</i>, their own confession, and in their
own Language, viz. <i>That they may be the veriest Knaves
in England</i>. Because they may put in bad ingredients,
and more or less then the composition requires, they
may substitute one thing for another; and all this without
being detected, and consequently not be punished
for such misdemeanors; but more especially in Medicines

<a class="pb" name="8" id="png006"></a>

for private mens uses, wherein they may do what
they please without the least discovery of the <i>Patient</i>,
and from this general confession of theirs, it clearly
follows, that whatsoever deceit, covetous wits can
invent, may at least be suspected to be used by them,
and whatsoever is here alledged may find easier
belief.
</p>

<p>
<i>And Secondly</i>, Most men wonder, that this <i>Corporation</i>,
being but of few years standing, and to the
setting up of whose Trade so small a Stock is necessary;
should live so high, spend so freely, gain so great Estates,
by their return of so little money yearly, which how
'tis done every man may conceive to be effected by the
following Artifices.
</p>

<p>
More particularly, the Frauds by them committed
relate either to their falsifying of <i>Medicines</i>, or secondly,
to the number of their Bills, and prescriptions,
or thirdly, to the prices of them.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i>, They use <i>Medicines</i> quite contrary to the
prescription, <i>Myrtle-leafs</i> shewed the <i>Censors</i> for <i>Sena</i>,
a Binder for a Purger.   <i>Mushroms</i> of the Oak, <i>&amp;c.</i>
rub'd over with Chalk for <i>Agaric</i>, which Mr. <i>Evelyn</i> in
his late publisht Book of <i>Forest Trees</i>, pag. 27. observes,
to the great scandal of <i>Physic</i> as he adds; <i>Hemlock-Dropwort</i>
Roots for <i>Pæony</i> Roots, Poysons for wholesome remedies;
<i>Privet</i> by some, by others <i>Dog-berries</i>, for those
of <i>Spina Cervina</i>, no Purgers for a strong one.  <i>Sheeps
Lungs</i> for <i>Fox Lungs</i>, the <i>Bone</i> of an <i>Oxe Heart</i> for that
of a <i>Stags Heart</i>, <i>Damsons</i> for <i>Damasc Prunes</i>, Syrup
of <i>Limons</i>, for that of <i>Citrons</i>, <i>Bryony</i> Roots for <i>Mechoacan</i>,
&amp;c.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, They falsify the grand Compositions of

<a class="pb" name="9" id="png007"></a>

the <i>London Dispensatory</i>. It being a common trade
with them to buy unsound, and decayed Simples of
some <i>Druggists</i>, and to return them back so much of the
composition as will pay for the Simples. Secondly,
whereas <i>Apothecaries</i> are bound to shew publickly to
the <i>Censors</i> of the <i>College</i>, and the <i>Master</i> and <i>Wardens</i>
of their Company, <i>Mithridate</i>, <i>Diascordium</i>, <i>Alkermes</i>,
&amp;c. Yet for all this some of them privately make a
great deal more of the Composition then is shewed, of
unsound Drugs, and some without any view at all;
others put in the Scrapings that ought to be thrown
away; and by these Arts they under-sell, and ruine one
another, selling the Composition at a lower rate then
good Ingredients cost them; and with these complaints
they daily mutiny amongst themselves.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, 'Tis very common for them to load Medicines
with Honey, and other cheaper ingredients, and
to leave out in whole or in part, those of greater value;
<i>viz. Saffron</i> in <i>Ruffus</i> Pills, and in <i>Oxycroceum</i> Plaster,
which latter, they colour of a <i>saffron</i> colour with <i>Turmeric</i>,
<i>Sanders</i> &amp;c. <i>Ambergrise in Alkermes</i>, <i>Diascordium</i>
was found by the <i>Censors</i> in their search made only of
<i>Honey</i>, and <i>Bole-Armeniac</i>. Which false composition
was taken away by the then Master of the Company.
</p>

<p>
Such <i>Chymists</i> which sell preparations honestly made
complain, that few <i>Apothecaries</i> will go to the prices
of them. Whence it comes to pass, that most of the preparations
found in the Shops are sophisticated, to the
great abuse of City and Country. These abuses daily
increase since the <i>Censors</i>, discouraged by the multitude
of <i>Empirics</i> swarming in every Corner, have
omitted their wonted searches, being to their loss of

<a class="pb" name="10" id="png008"></a>

time, and expences out of their own Purses for the
publick good only. Now since the <i>Chymical</i> Oyls, by
reason of their great prices are most of them adulterated,
and very few of them right good, and that nothing
hath been published on this matter, and to leave
the buyers of them unexcusable, I shall here add
briefly, yet sufficiently the ways to discover these
Cheats. First for sweet-scented <i>Chymical</i> Oyls, <i>viz.</i>
those of <i>Cloves</i>, <i>Cinnamon</i> and <i>Sassaphras</i>. Only drop
a little of them into fair water, and that part which is
true good will sink under the water, but the adulterated
part will swim on the top of it. Some others draw
deep tinctures from the said Spices with Spirit of Wine
highly rectified, and sell them for the Oyls; but these
mix with the water throughout, neither swimming, nor
sinking. Others more craftily digest with the said tinctures
some of the true Oyls, which compound being
put into water, will for a time render it white. Another
way of sophisticating is with Oyl of <i>Turpentine</i>
mixed in great quantity with that which is adulterated;
You may easily discover the Oyl of <i>Turpentine</i>,
by setting it on fire, for it yields abundance of ill-scented
smoak, with very little savour of the Herb,
Flour, or Seed, <i>&amp;c.</i> and soon takes fire. To correct
the ill smell of the <i>Turpentine</i>, they digest it with, and
distil it off with <i>Spirit of Wine</i>. Those sophisticated
with <i>Turpentine</i>, fired in a Silver Spoon colour it, and
quickly diffuse themselves upon a Knife, or Paper. The
best way to try by firing, is to put a drop or two of
these Oyls on the end of a broad pointed Knife, which
being first heated, and then thrust into a lighted Candle,
presently take fire, and break out into a flame

<a class="pb" name="11" id="png009"></a>

with much dark smoak; but if you will try them in a
Spoon, heat it first over a Candle, and then blow the
flame of lighted paper, or of a Wax Candle on them.
To try the scent, blow out the flame of the good Oyls,
and your smell will soon discover the ill scent of the
<i>Turpentine</i> from that of the good Oyl. But on the contrary,
all Oyls drawn from Plants by distillation
hardly flame, and the flame soon goes out, and the
smoak gives a full flavour of the Plant it self, whereas
those sophisticated as before, differ from the true in
both. The same Oyls are also sophisticated with cheap
ones drawn from decayed <i>Oringes</i>, and <i>Limons</i>; Your
smell on firing will soon discover these mixtures. A
third way of sophisticating <i>Chymical</i> Oyls is, by mixing
with them such Oyls as are made by expression,
which are easily discovered by rubbing them on white
paper, which being held and dryed at the fire, the <i>Chymical</i>
part soon flyes away, and leaves the paper transparent,
looking no otherwise then oyled paper; but
pure <i>Chymical</i> Oyls totally fly away, leaving the paper
white as 'twas before, and not transparent, and in
this way Oyl of sweet Almonds and Spike have a great
share. As for Oyls drawn by <i>Retort</i>, they all of them
smell so strong of the fire, that neither smell nor tast
can well discover any fraud in them. Now for the
<i>fixed Salts</i>, most of them are made of the Ashes of
<i>Tobacco-stalks</i>, &amp;c. More might be said for the discovery
of the Cheats of other <i>Chymical</i> preparations,
which shall be reserved to another opportunity, and
had <i>Physicians</i> just encouragement, they would spend
both their time and moneys on the like discoveries for
the publick Utility.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="12" id="png010"></a>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, Add to the former (though perhaps 'tis an
error of ignorance only) that if such Simples are prescribed
they know not, they fetch from the Herb-women
what they give them, true or false; for many of
these Women give to very many Plants false names;
Now if the <i>Apothecary</i> be so careful to consult an Herbal,
which few have, and fewer know how to make use
of, yet they too frequently mistake the thing by reason
of several names given to the same thing, or of one name
to several things, and many of them consult the common
<i>Dictionaries</i> only, which are most erroneous in
the names of natural things; insomuch that in my first
practice (being curious of these particulars) I have
found two or three mistakes in one prescription, a Catalogue
of which mistakes, and names ill given, I had
collected, but the late fire consumed it, though many
of them my memory hath reserved.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, Many of the <i>London</i>, and most of the <i>Country-Apothecaries</i>,
buy of the whole-sale men, who
affirm of one another, especially of such who gain
great Estates in short time, that they cannot sell their
Medicines honestly made at so low a rate as they
do.
</p>

<p>
<i>Seventhly</i>, I shall need to say little of such <i>distilled
waters</i>, as discover themselves neither to smell, nor
tast, but shall only recite a known Story of an <i>Apothecary</i>,
who chid his man for sending away a Customer
that came for <i>Plantan</i> water, telling him there was
enough at the Pump.
</p>

<p>
<i>Eighthly</i>, As for <i>Ointments</i>, and <i>Plasters</i>, they are sold
by some at so low a price, <i>viz. 3 d. per</i> l. for <i>Ointments</i>,
as I have been informed, that 'tis not possible to make

<a class="pb" name="13" id="png011"></a>

them at, and yet such however falsifyed maintain a
trade amongst Country, and low-priced City-<i>Apothecaries</i>,
and the <i>Chirurgeons</i> profess they cannot effect
their Cures with the Shop-Medicines, and that this is
the reason why they make their own <i>Oyls</i>, <i>Oyntments</i>,
&amp;c. as the <i>Apothecaries</i> Charter allows them to do;
and why may not <i>Physicians</i> think this to be the cause
why they sometimes fail in their Cures, as well as <i>Chirurgeons?</i>
and also make their own Medicines as well
as they, especially since the <i>Apothecary</i> may as easily
falsify, and to greater profit in the one, then in the
other?
</p>

<p>
<i>Ninthly</i>, As to their use of bad or decayed <i>Drugs</i>,
'tis so common a practice that I shall need to give but
one notorious instance of it, and 'tis this, I having occasion
to use some Seeds, sent for them to a Seeds-man,
the Messenger desiring to have those of the same
Year. The Tradesman knowing him to live with me,
asked, if they were for Physical use, he replyed in the
affirmative, whereat he presently shewed him others,
which were of 6 or 7 years old (as he confessed) affirming
them to be as good for that use as the newest,
which he sold only for sowing, and that he kept the
others, though never so old, for the <i>Apothecaries</i> only,
who still asked for them, buying them though 20 years
old, not regarding if they were decayed and wholy
effete (for no Seed will preserve its vegetative faculty
above 7 years much less its Physical) so they could but
have them cheap. Besides their pretty knacks (as
they call them) of making their Compounds fair to
the eye, more vendible, but worse for use, by restoring
them to their colour and consistence, that

<a class="pb" name="14" id="png012"></a>

they may pass for good, which perhaps 'tis better
to pass over in silence, lest by confuting I should
teach the younger Fry, who may better be honestly
ignorant of them. Now for their substituting one
thing for another, and detracting where they please,
I shall add but one Story of an <i>Apothecary</i>, who commanded
his man (who told him they had no good
<i>Rhabarb</i> in the house) that he should put in double
quantity of what they had. Nay I have known
one simple of a quite different nature used for a whole
composition.
</p>

<p>
<i>Tenthly</i>, I shall conclude this ungrateful Discourse,
with saying that by reason more frauds may be committed
by the <i>Apothecaries</i>, then by any other Trade,
and by supposition that gain will tempt most men to
dishonest actions, especially where they may act undiscovered;
I say; that this seems to be the cause why
they have two Supervisors set over them more then
any Company that I know of, <i>viz.</i> the <i>Censors</i> of the
<i>College</i> of <i>Physicians</i>, and the <i>Master</i> and <i>Wardens</i> of
their own Company.
</p>

<p>
The next thing is the inlarging and multiplying
their Bills and Medicines.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i>, When in Chronical Diseases a <i>Physician</i> is
consulted, they go on of their own heads with the
same prescription, frequently enough to the Patients
great disadvantage, both of health and purse.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, By giving and intermixing Medicines of
their own Phancy, with the <i>Physicians</i> prescriptions,
<i>viz.</i> some pleasing Medicine, whereby too often the
<i>Physicians</i> intention is quite crost, and the effect made
uncertain, and hazardous.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="15" id="png013"></a>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, By giving Medicines themselves on small
accounts, and such as require only a good ordering,
and no more.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, By repeating long courses of <i>Physic</i> unadvisedly,
and needlesly, when either nothing, or very
little is needful to be done.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, By creating diseases in easie mens Phansies,
and so decoying them into courses of <i>Physic</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, Some of them get private and worthless
receipts, and sell them at what rate they please; Mr.
<i>Delaune</i> by one Pill alone, though not a very safe one,
got some thousands of pounds.
</p>

<p>
<i>Seventhly</i>, If one of them get a private receipt from
a <i>Physician</i> called by the inventor his <i>Nostrum</i>, if another
<i>Apothecary</i> have occasion to use it, he shall be sure
to pay sawce for it.
</p>

<p>
<i>Eighthly</i>, Another trick is when the <i>Patient</i> is cured,
and the <i>Physician</i> therefore hath given over his Visits,
then comes the <i>Apothecary</i> and insinuates by his words
and passions, either some danger of relapse, or some
other present distemper, and repairs to the <i>Physician</i>
for a Bill to cure the imaginary disease.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ninthly</i>, But their principal Art of all is, to cry up,
and bring in to <i>Patients</i> such <i>Physicians</i>, who through
design must comply with the <i>Apothecaries</i> Interest, and
such Practisers they extol and cry up for good <i>Physicians</i>,
which some of them call more expresly good
<i>Apothecaries Physicians</i>, and such without doubt, the
whole Company will endeavour to raise unto a fame
and practice. But such as write only for the good of the
<i>Patient</i>, and not at all for the benefit of the <i>Apothecary</i>
(as all honest men ought to do) they will endeavour

<a class="pb" name="16" id="png014"></a>

to prevent their calling in, or to shuffle them
out.
</p>

<p>
Now this good <i>Apothecaries Physician</i>, they describe
by his frequent though needless visits, but especially by
the multitude of his Bills, by his visiting twice a day,
or oftner (a very careful and painful <i>Doctor</i>) and by
still writing new Medicines, when half the former, or
perhaps none of them have been taken, making an
<i>Apothecaries</i> Shop in the <i>Patients</i> House, planting the
Cupboards and Windows with Glasses and Gally-Pots,
and not a quarter of the whole made use of.
He prescribes a Medicine for every slight complaint,
and never goes away from the <i>Patient</i> or the <i>Patient</i>
from him, without a Bill, for fear of the <i>Apothecaries</i>
grumbling.
</p>

<p>
And from this burdening the sick with multiplicity
of Medicines, too often contrary to, and destructive
one of another, it proceeds that in the <i>Small Pox</i>, and
<i>Measles</i>, many are afraid to use <i>Physicians</i>, and commit
the care of the sick to <i>Nurses</i>, and <i>Old Women</i>, and
perhaps sometimes not without cause, for by continual
multiplication of Medicines, the humours of the
body may be made, or kept in too great a state of fluidity,
whence the <i>Flox</i> followeth. Whereas a Medicine
or two duly administred, may suffice to bring
them well forth, and then there needs no more but
good ordering, unless perhaps some accident arise,
which may require further care. And here as well as
in other Cases, the <i>Patient</i> is to be rectified, who requires
the <i>Physicians</i> Visits, and yet dismisseth him
without a reward, unless he writes a Bill, whereas it
might have been better if nothing at all had been prescribed;

<a class="pb" name="17" id="png015"></a>

and the <i>Physician</i> left to his own judgment;
and hence it is that many enlarge their Bills, that the
Patient may think he hath enough for his money,
whereby the <i>Apothecary</i> is gratified, who ought to
commend the Medicines as necessary for the sick person,
and singular in themselves, whereas in truth this
great farcy proves ungrateful to the tast and stomach;
inconvenient to health, by curing one disease, but
creating more; and by this means keeping them continually
in a way of <i>Physic</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>A third</i> abuse of the <i>Apothecaries</i> relates to the prices
of their Medicines; first they put what rates they
please on their Simples, Compounds, and Receipts,
and none are judges of them, but those of their own
Trade; insomuch that they gain a 11 <i>d.</i> in the Shilling,
if they say true of themselves. Whereas the <i>Colleges
of Physicians</i> beyond Sea, yearly set a tax upon the
<i>Simples</i>, and <i>Compounds</i> of the Shops. So that the
Customer can tell the price of what he hath occasion
to use, and not stand at the mercy of the
<i>Apothecary</i> to rate them as he lists, and to this purpose
they put in print the prices of them every
year.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, Suppose a <i>Physician</i> hath prescribed a
Pint of <i>Juleb</i>, &amp;c. to be taken at four several times,
some <i>Apothecaries</i> carry not the whole pint at once,
but divide it into four parts, and carry but one at a
time, and so of other Medicines, and then will charge
their Bill for every single <i>Potion</i>, or Draught, as they
ought the whole Pint; so that by this Art they gain
four times as much for the whole Medicine as in Conscience
they ought; and a <i>Juleb</i>, which cost them six

<a class="pb" name="18" id="png016"></a>

pence, will be rated at 10, 12, or more Shillings. But
perhaps 'tis fit they should be paid for their created
Visits; and for this unnecessary officiousness, persons
of great estates may be contented to pay roundly, if
they please.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, When a <i>Physician</i> hath prescribed 20
Pills, some of the <i>Apothecaries</i> will make 30 of them,
under pretence the <i>Patient</i> cannot swallow them else;
now reckoning each Pill at a certain rate (as they
usually do) they gain a third part more then they
ought.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, To advance the prices, you shall hardly
ever see a Bill without <i>Bezoar</i>, or <i>Pearls</i> in it, to make
people think them very chargeable; whereas sometimes
there is not above a grain or two of these dear
ingredients in the prescription, and a few grains of
these or <i>Ambergrise</i> doubles or trebles the prices of the
Medicines, and are sure never to be omitted in their
Bills, besides the guilding of the Pills, and covering
their <i>Bolusses</i>, and <i>Electuaries</i> with <i>Gold</i> (which have
only an imaginary and no real use in Medicines so
used) much inhanseth their prices, and a rich <i>Cordial</i>
inserted exceedingly advanceth most of their Bills;
or if China or any other dear ingredient be in the receipt
'tis not omitted.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, Some <i>Apothecaries</i> offer, and perhaps some
<i>Physicians</i> have taken presents to help them to Customers,
which must necessarily be squeazed out of
their higher-rated Medicines.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, I have heard some prudent persons complain
of their bringing in their Bills but once in a year,
or two; supposing they made them pay <i>Lombards</i>

<a class="pb" name="19" id="png017"></a>

Usury for their forbearance. And through this neglect
they sometimes lose their money, and whether they
raise other Mens Bills to make up these losses, I affirm
not.
</p>

<p>
<i>Seventhly</i>, Another cause of raising their prices is a
necessity of keeping in their Shops such Medicines as
are seldom used, or such as must upon necessity decay,
and grow useless. Now suppose they throw such away,
this reason is good, but you will find a remedy for
this hereafter.
</p>

<p>
To conclude this second Complaint. By reason of
the dear Bills of the <i>Apothecaries</i>, many are deterred
from going to the <i>Physician</i>, and run to common <i>Mountebanks</i>,
and I think this to be the reason (as some
disabused persons have confessed to me) why they have
so much cryed up the abilities of <i>Apothecaries</i> for practice,
because they would save their credit in taking
<i>Physic</i> of them. St. <i>Augustine</i> candidly in his Book of
Confessions declares, that through covetousness he
repeated a course of <i>Physic</i>, without consulting the
<i>Physician</i> (who had before cured him of the same disease)
to his greater charge, danger of his life, and
offence against God.
</p>

<p>
Having done with the <i>Apothecaries</i> abuses relating
chiefly to the <i>Patients</i> Health and Purse, and
such as are willfully committed (though all of
them reflect on the <i>Physician</i>) I shall now touch on
a few neglects, and mistakes proving often very
mischievous.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i>, They frequently mistake the <i>Physicians</i> directions,
which of what dangerous consequence it is,
every one can tell.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="20" id="png018"></a>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, They carry a Medicine appointed for
one sick person to another.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, They often neglect the sending of Medicines
in due time, especially such as have no Servants,
or but raw ones, when the Master is out of Town, or
upon long visits.
</p>

<p>
Having now done with the <i>Apothecaries</i> as they relate
principally to the sick, I shall in the next place
speak of them, as they relate to <i>Physicians</i>, and that
either to the profession in general, or to the particular
practisers of it.
</p>

<p>
As to the <i>Physicians</i> in general, they endeavour to
extirpate them, and some have been so bold to say,
they hope in few years to see never a <i>Physician</i> in <i>London</i>,
and to profess they will scramble with them for
practice. And that this hath been and is their intention,
the following particulars will clearly demonstrate.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i>, They have always endeavoured and aimed
at the depression and ruine of the <i>College</i> of <i>Physicians</i>,
the only <i>Corporation</i> of that Art in <i>England</i>, considering
rightly, that the depression of the <i>College</i> is
their interest and rise, and that the total subversion of
it will make them absolute Masters in <i>Physic</i> and <i>Physicians</i>
their Servants. In Order hereunto they have
constantly, both publickly and privately opposed the
<i>College</i> in whatsoever hath been offered to setle the
liberty of practice on them, their only priviledg and
subsistence, though they have been offered all they
could desire for the security of their Trade, and legal
employment, and far beyond whatsoever any Corporation
of <i>Apothecaries</i> in all, or in any forreign part

<a class="pb" name="21" id="png019"></a>

enjoy, yet nothing would ever content them, but an
unlawful, unreasonable, dangerous, and destructive
Usurpation of liberty to some pretended practice, that
thereby they might gain the whole.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, They have continually traduced the <i>College</i>,
and troubled them in <i>Parliaments</i>, at the <i>Council</i>-Board,
<i>&amp;c.</i> to their great charge and molestation.
And for such their great demerits against the <i>College</i>,
the <i>King</i> and his <i>Council</i>, <i>Anno</i> 1639. granted a <i>Quo
Warranto</i> to the <i>Attorney General</i> (the <i>Judges</i> having
first heard the whole matter) to take away their
<i>Charter</i>, which doubtless had been effected, had not
the troubles, and long civil War immediately
ensued.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, And in this present <i>Parliament</i>, how did
they endeavour to prepossess the Members of the
House of Commons with strange, and false prejudices
and assertions drawn from irrational, and groundless
suppositions, making us the greatest Tyrants in the
World, inferring ridiculously that a <i>Lady</i>, or Charitable
<i>Gentlewoman</i> (for in that believing Sex they have
gain'd a great deal of ground by their falsities) might
not give the Poor a <i>Cordial</i>, &amp;c. without being questioned
by the <i>College</i>; whereas they know in their
Consciences, that the <i>College</i> hath power enough by
their first Charter to act as much in this kind against
themselves, and all other persons, as they desired of this
present <i>Parliament</i>;  And yet neither <i>Apothecary</i>, or
any other who practised charitably, were ever troubled
for so doing. They pretended also they were
abridged wholy from their Trade, and might not sell
a penny-worth of <i>Mithridate</i>, &amp;c. without a <i>Doctors</i>

<a class="pb" name="22" id="png020"></a>

Bill. Whereas there's not a word in the Charter to
that purpose; the sole intent whereof was to keep
them as well as other <i>Mountebanks</i>, from prescribing
(which they call selling) the <i>Physicians</i> only livelyhood.
And as to the bill itself so much railed on by
them in <i>Westminster-Hall</i>, <i>Coffee-Houses</i>, <i>Ale-Houses</i>,
&amp;c. 'tis easie to make it out, that this Charter as proposed
gives the <i>Apothecaries</i> more liberty and freedom
of exercising their lawful Trade, then is enjoyed in
any other Nation, where both Corporations are
erected, and that it doth in nothing infringe, or diminish
their freedom as <i>Citizens</i>, or their Charter as <i>Apothecaries</i>;
and that our Charter was compiled by some,
and perused and approved by others the most eminent
<i>Lawyers</i> in <i>England</i> for Worth and Place; and yet
none of these could find any thing in it either Illegal,
Tyrannical, or unfit to be desired of the <i>Parliament</i>.
Nay many mis-informed Members being rightly instructed
in the true state of the matter, have acknowledged
the justice of it; And was no more then
King <i>James</i> by his Letters Patents, dated the 18th of
<i>October</i>, in the 15th year of his Reign, granted to the
said <i>College</i>; near about the same time the <i>Apothecaries</i>
Charter was granted; and being almost nothing
else but a supply of what was short in their former
Grants, <i>viz.</i> That whereas their Charter granted by
King <i>Henry</i> the Eighth, gave power to punish offenders
in the practice of Physic; and because there was
no power given to summon, nor penalty imposed for
the non-appearance of such offenders; therefore by
their non-appearance, the said power of the <i>Censors</i>
was eluded; for no such offenders would appear before

<a class="pb" name="23" id="png021"></a>

them, and consequently no punishment could be
inflicted on them, according to the true meaning of the
said Act. Now this Charter so much declaimed against,
prayed only a supply of this defect, and also better
and more necessary ways and means, without which,
such and all other offenders against the lives and
healths of his Majesties Subjects could not be discovered;
and they had reason not to doubt a grant of
the said power, since by the said Charter a power
was granted them to imprison offenders, whom the
Keepers of the Prisons would not receive, because no
command, nor penalty was imposed on them, for not
receiving such offenders sent by the <i>Censors</i> (a thing
ridiculous to our present Lawyers) however this defect
was supplyed by an Act in the first of Queen <i>Mary</i>.
Now whereas since the making of the said Acts and
Powers, granted to the <i>College</i>, several other Trades,
besides the <i>Apothecaries</i>, relating to Physic (being
then all Members of the Grocers Company) <i>viz.</i>
Druggists, Chymists, Sellers of Strong-Waters and
Oyls, have arose distinct from each others, and many
abuses have been and are committed in each of them,
as they all confess. The said Charter prays for the
publick good only (there being the same reason of all)
they might have the same power of Surveying them
also, as they have of the <i>Apothecaries</i>, which most of
the Judicious, and sober of the said Companies, as
well in relation to their own private profit, and also
the publick, by having all Medicines good, did not
oppose, but liked well of. Nay there was nothing in
the said Charter, but what was judged good by all or
most of the Judges of <i>England</i>, several times convened

<a class="pb" name="24" id="png022"></a>

by Order of the King and his Council, to deliver
their opinions concerning some Quæries, which comprised
the main of what was desired and petitioned
for by the <i>College</i>, of this present Parliament. But before
the <i>Committee</i> could make report to the House,
the <i>Parliament</i> was adjourned, whereupon <i>Apothecaries</i>
falsly gave out, and made people believe our Charter
was taken from us. And in this transaction before the
<i>Committee</i>, one <i>Cocket</i> an <i>Apothecary</i> exhibited in the
name of the <i>Chymists</i> such a Scandalous Libel, as the
<i>Committee</i> would not suffer to be read; drawn as some
conceive by the assistance, and countenance, if not
contrivance of his Company.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lastly</i>, The Company of the <i>Apothecaries</i> are bound
by their Charter to bring their Servants (before they
make them Free) to be examined by the <i>Censors</i> of our
<i>College</i>, and to have their approbation of their fitness
to exercise their Art, and set up their Trade. Now
that they have herein neglected their duty, and consequently
may be dis-franchised and lose their Freedoms
for this omission, 'tis manifest not only by the
vapours of some of them to some members of our
Body, that they never underwent this examination;
but also by comparing of our Register (wherein are
recorded the names of all such as have been examined)
with theirs, if they keep any for this purpose.
Sure I am, that in two years together, when I was
<i>Censor</i>, very few, if any, did appear to their examination,
whereas yearly a very great number set up their
Trades. Nay since the firing of <i>London</i> not one <i>Apothecaries</i>
Servant hath been examined by the <i>Censors</i>,
for more then these three Years last past, in which time

<a class="pb" name="25" id="png023"></a>

perhaps no less then 100 have been made free by the
Company.
</p>

<p>
Before our presenting this Charter to the <i>Parliament</i>,
they would admit no Arbitrators betwixt our Corporation,
and Theirs, not contenting themselves with
their Charter lately granted in <i>King James's Reign</i>, and
that by the procurement of some of our <i>College</i> for
these unthankful persons.   For they would not refer
themselves (as the <i>Chirurgeons</i> without many words or
dispute did) to the most upright, and most knowing
Sir <i>Orlando Bridgeman</i> then <i>Lord Chief Justice</i>, and now
<i>Lord Keeper</i>, for a clause to be by him drawn, in order
to preserve their immunities and Charter; which they
refused, fearing belike he would exclude them from
the Practice of <i>Physic</i>, which the Law hath already
done, and which is all they could doubt of; but
the Corporation of <i>Chirurgeons</i> did acquiesce in the
clause drawn by the said <i>Lord Chief Justice</i>, and
never appeared before the Committee against the said
Charter.
</p>

<p>
Their increasing dis-respect, and undervaluing the
<i>College</i>, appears in this, that of late years they place
our <i>Censors</i> invited to their new Masters Dinner, at
their second Tables whereas always heretofore they
were seated at the first Table, next to the Master of
the Company.
</p>

<p>
And to hinder the building of a New <i>College</i>, and
the Contribution of the Honorary Fellows thereunto,
they tell them that we deceived them in their admission,
and never intend the building of a New <i>College</i>,
though a large  contribution hath been made, and

<a class="pb" name="26" id="png024"></a>

ground purchased in order thereunto by the Members
of their Corporation.
</p>

<p>
And their further design appears in their great triumphing,
and rejoycing when any illiterate person hath
gained any reputation for a Cure performed, especially
where <i>Physicians</i> have been concerned, though the
<i>Patients</i> neglect or obstinateness, have been the sole
cause of this non-performance, and by their continued
detraction from <i>Physicians</i>, and applauding themselves,
hoping by the former, that people will think
such <i>Mountebanks</i> able to do better Cures then learned
<i>Physicians</i>, and then they can easily insinuate themselves
superior to such <i>Mountebanks</i>, and consequently
to <i>Physicians</i>. By the latter, they seek to depress,
and level us to themselves, being conscious they can
never rise to that worth and ability, required in a
<i>Physician</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another manifest sign of their endeavour to usurp
our Practice is, their absurd calling the sick their <i>Patients</i>,
for 'tis most certain that in all reason and language
the <i>Physician</i> and <i>Patient</i> only have relation to
each other, but not to the <i>Apothecary</i>, who is but a
Tradesman, and manual Operator. Now a Tradesman
and his Customer, or Chapman, are Relatives
each to other, but those <i>Apothecaries</i> who intrude
themselves and usurp on our profession, may call their
Customers <i>Patients</i>, and that in a true literal sence,
when by their ignorance they make them really sufferers
under them; and if they deny <i>Apothecary</i> and
<i>Patient</i> to be non-sence, they shew themselves pitifully
ignorant in the Laws, and Rules of Reason, or else

<a class="pb" name="27" id="png025"></a>

profess themselves <i>Physicians</i>. And the like non-sence
they commonly utter by calling <i>Physicians</i> that make
their own Medicines, <i>Mountebanks</i> and <i>Quacks</i>,
whereas none can be such but those who practise
without Lawful Authority, as the <i>Apothecaries</i>, &amp;c.
do; and they are not ignorant in this their malice, that
the Law of <i>England</i> would punish them roundly for
so saying. And were I troublesome or vindicative, I
could make some of them examples, but I freely remit
the slanders in this kind that are past.
</p>

<p>
Having done with the main part of the Disease, next
follows the Remedy; and the only firm and proper
one will appear to be, that <i>Physicians</i> make their own
Medicines; the benefit whereof to the publick, the
reasonableness of the thing it self, the necessity in relation
to the <i>Physician</i>, will be manifest by that which
follows.
</p>

<p>
And <i>First</i>, All that hath been said demonstrates this
last proportion.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, The desire of most persons, and the censure
of all wise men, who say we are wanting to our
own interest, if we make not use of the remedy in
our own hands, performing our Art in all its
members, whereof making of Medicines is a chief
one.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, The common practice, and constant usage
of all former and antient <i>Physicians</i> in all other Nations,
and in <i>England</i> also (for 'tis easie to say when there
was not one <i>Apothecary</i> in this Kingdom) the Laws of
our Nation, nay even the <i>Apothecaries</i> Charter allow
it, the Language of all <i>Physicians</i>, our <i>College</i> voting it
honourable so to do, nay <i>Apothecaries</i> themselves commending

<a class="pb" name="28" id="png026"></a>

it in such <i>Physicians</i> as buy their Medicines of
them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, The Kings <i>Physicians</i> have formerly
made the Kings Medicines, as 'tis manifest by my
Lord <i>Coke</i>, in his 4<i>th.</i> Book of the Institutes, <i>part</i> 4.
<i>pag.</i> 251. where he comments on <i>Rot. Pat.</i> 32 <i>H</i> 6.
m. 17. He there first recites the Roll it self, wherein
are appointed (the King being then sick) 3 <i>Physicians</i>
and 2 <i>Chirurgeons</i>, to freely minister and execute
Physic about the Kings Person, and there are also recited
in general, Medicines external, and internal.
And on this Roll <i>Coke</i> among other things infers, that
the <i>Physicians</i> may use the aid of those <i>Chirurgeons</i>
named in the Warrant, but of no <i>Apothecary</i>, but to
prepare and do all things themselves, <i>&amp;c.</i> And the
reason of all this is, the precious regard had of the
health and safety of the King, who is the head of the
Common-wealth. And I am told by one of his present
Majesties <i>Physicians</i>, that the King himself affirmed
heretofore we are unwise in neglecting our duty
herein, and lately of these papers, that 'twas the publick
interest so to do.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, <i>Chirurgeons</i> (as before) will not trust them
to make external Remedies; and the King, and <i>East-India</i>
Company commit the making of their Chests
for their Fleets to the <i>Chirurgeons</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, Have not Ladies and Charitable Gentlewomen
their Closets well furnished with various Medicines
for the Poors use, and for their own also, when
<i>Physicians</i> are called to their houses in the Country?
Distillers of Strong-waters, Makers of Plaisters, Confectioners
make Medicines bought by the <i>Apothecaries</i>,

<a class="pb" name="29" id="png027"></a>

Ale-Houses sell purging Drinks, and Book-sellers sell
Chymical Medicines, and all this without much regret
of the <i>Apothecaries</i>. But if a <i>Physician</i> intermix a Medicine
with theirs, though the <i>Patients</i> life be saved
thereby, what noise, and murmuring, and proclaiming
of it the next Market-day to the rest of their Company?
to what purpose any one may judg.
</p>

<p>
<i>Seventhly</i>, Why should not <i>Physicians</i>, being lawfully
authorized thereunto, practise with their own
Medicines, as well as the <i>Apothecaries</i> with theirs,
though against Law, and incurring thereby the penalty
of 5<i>l. per</i> Month, which the <i>College</i> never troubled
them for, or exacted of them?
</p>

<p>
<i>Eighthly</i>, Physicians will be necessitated to it for
their subsistence and honour, and to preserve their Art
from being prostituted to illiterate persons, the <i>Apothecaries</i>
becoming now their Competitors.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ninthly</i>, By this means <i>Physicians</i> will avoid multitudes
of inconveniencies, proceeding from writing of
Bills, and the <i>Apothecaries</i> Visits.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i> The mistakes, and frauds in the Ingredients,
especially committed by the great practising <i>Apothecaries</i>,
who may, as appears by the following story, be
suspected to send, instead of what was prescribed, the
remains of his own practice, or else some cast-by Medicines;
for else how could it be when a Medicine was
prescribed to stand in Infusion or steep a whole night,
that it should be brought two hours after the Bill was
written, even the very same Evening? Which by accident
the <i>Patient</i> confessed, wanting the expected success.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i> By this course <i>Physicians</i> avoid the many
opprobrious terms cast upon them by <i>Apothecaries</i>:
</p>

<a class="pb" name="30" id="png028"></a>

<p>
As <i>First</i>, In saying that if he had not omitted or
added something, the <i>Patient</i> might have miscarried;
which he may say at pleasure without any contradiction,
though doubtless many have been killed by this
means.
</p>

<p>
<i>Secondly</i>, By saying the Bill could never have been
made without some alteration of the <i>Apothecary</i>,
thereby insinuating the <i>Doctors</i> ignorance in compounding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, In saying the <i>Doctor</i> is not versed in Medicines,
because forsooth he varieth not at every
Visit, and multiplieth not new Bills for the <i>Apothecaries</i>
profit.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, In saying they teach <i>Physicians</i>, and help
them to, and in their practice. The first and last are
vile and foolish Scandals; as to the Second, 'tis true
indeed, that younger <i>Apothecaries</i> recommend <i>Physicians</i>
to their acquaintance; but 'tis no longer then
they have learned enough (as they think) to set up for
themselves.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i>, In saying, they knew before-hand what
such a <i>Doctor</i> would prescribe, and hence it is they have
nick-named some <i>Physicians</i> of no mean practice, by
the Medicines they frequently use, which names in
respect to the persons, I shall conceal; and of such
<i>Physicians</i>, they brag they can prescribe as well as they.
But if a <i>Physician</i> advise things unknown to them, or
out of the common tract, then they say the <i>Doctor</i>
intends to puzzle them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, He will avoid the censure of his Bills, which
every pitiful fellow, nay their very Boys will absolve
or condemn at pleasure, and that openly too, nay sometimes

<a class="pb" name="31" id="png029"></a>

to the <i>Patient</i> himself, and thereby call in his
good <i>Apothecaries Physician</i>. Now what a shame is it,
that a <i>Physicians</i> credit and livelihood, should stand at
the mercy of such pitiful ignorant, and self-ended
Souls? I have heard one of them say of the now most
Eminent Practiser in <i>London</i>, that his Boy could write
as good a Method as he, and that he understood the
practice of <i>Physic</i> as well as any <i>Physician</i> in <i>London</i>
except 2, or 3, though the same person was soon made
to confess, he neither knew the Disease, Cause, nor
Cure of a Pleurisy, pretended to be throughly understood by
him.
</p>

<p>
<i>Thirdly</i>, He will avoid the trouble put upon him
after he hath writ his Bill, by the <i>Apothecaries</i> ignorance
in not understanding it, who to be informed
came to the <i>Doctor</i> heretofore, with their Hats
off, but now send their Boys, who soon put theirs
on. Such respect do they give <i>Physicians</i>, when
they come to them as to their Masters to teach
them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fourthly</i>, He will avoid the impertinent Visits of
the <i>Apothecaries</i>, and non-sensical, troublesome, and
discouraging, frightful discourses to the <i>Patient</i>, of
whom no man can expect more then the Common
Proverb gives to Praters, and impertinent Speakers,
<i>That they talk like Apothecaries</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Fifthly</i> He will avoid the mischiefs from their Visits,
who by their shrugs, signs, or words, may diminish
the <i>Physicians</i> reputation, and good opinion, whether
in his skill, or Medicines, whereby good Medicines
are neglected and the expectation of a good success
upon the use of them taken away, or at least causing an

<a class="pb" name="32" id="png030"></a>

averseness to them; which actings do exceedingly prejudice
the <i>Patient</i>, in reference to his Cure.
</p>

<p>
<i>Sixthly</i>, He will avoid this inconvenience, that
some <i>Apothecaries</i> have attributed the Cure to some
of their intermixed Medicines, or alteration of the
<i>Doctors</i> Bill.
</p>

<p>
<i>Seventhly</i>, He will avoid that incivility of such of
them, who in the <i>Physicians</i> presence, will feel the
Pulse, judg of the Urine, discourse the Cause, Nature,
what the Disease is, and what will be the issue of
it, propose Medicines, nay sometimes endeavour to
advise with the <i>Physician</i>, to contradict and dispute
with him, to compare and set himself above the <i>Physician</i>;
and to say truth, these odious and intolerable
Comparisons and intrusions daily complained of by
my <i>Collegues</i>, were a great cause of my departing from
them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Eighthly</i>, He will avoid those Scandals they have
opportunity to raise, that such a <i>Physician</i> is Covetous,
Proud, Negligent, and minds not his practice,
and the like without the least ground, and are frequently
by such Artifices, the Cause of introducing
another <i>Physician</i>, knowing that thereby more Bills
will come to their File, and many times the former
Medicines be layed aside, and in this shuffling in
and out of <i>Physicians</i>, they have commonly a great
share.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ninthly</i>, <i>Apothecaries</i> being now Competitors with
<i>Physicians</i> for practice, and down-right Enemies to
such as make their own Medicines; why should not
we suspect them of this false Play, by telling the
<i>Patient</i> the <i>Doctors</i> Medicine will not work (which

<a class="pb" name="33" id="png031"></a>

he knows well enough how to effect) and then to tell
him he will prepare him one of his own that will work,
when perhaps that he calls his own preparation, was
nothing but what the <i>Doctor</i> had prescribed before;
and by this Artifice to advance himself above the
<i>Physician</i>.
</p>

<p>
Another mischief in sending Bills to the <i>Apothecaries</i>
is, that though the <i>Apothecaries</i> be honest (and who
can tell which of them is so?) yet the Servants neglect,
or ignorance (to whom they commit the whole
care of dispensing, and are intruth the <i>Apothecaries</i>
(and not their Masters) may mar all in their Masters
absence, who is visiting abroad, or at his recreations.
</p>

<p>
And now I have done with the unpleasant talk of
raking into the faults of the <i>Apothecaries</i>, and with
discoursing how <i>Physicians</i> may save themselves from
their devices, I shall next shew the advantages that will
come to the <i>Patient</i>, the <i>Physician</i>, and people, by this
way of remedy proposed.
</p>

<p>
As for the <i>Patients</i>, they may hereby save most of
the great charges of <i>Apothecaries</i> Bills, which in long
Cases amount to very great sums in a year, although
the <i>Physician</i> hath received very few Fees; the <i>Physician</i>
may so order his business as to take his Fee for
his Visits only, and at home such competent Fees for
his advice alone, as are usually given, and in both Cases
take nothing for his Medicines, and so save the
<i>Patient</i> the whole charge of the <i>Apothecaries</i> Bill,
which very seldom comes short, and for the most part
manifoldly exceeds the <i>Physicians</i> Fees. And this he
may very well do by making fewer, less chargable,

<a class="pb" name="34" id="png032"></a>

more effectual, and durable Medicines then the Shops
afford, and suffer nothing in the non-use, or decay of
his Medicines; because he need make no more then
will serve his own practice: and I must here profess,
that which I intended not to have published, that this
is the course I have generally taken, for the four
Months last past, since I made my own Medicines, but
that some <i>Apothecaries</i> have given out most falsly, that
I have sent in Bills to <i>Patients</i> for money; but to convince
such of their wonted lying, I do hereby oblige
my self to give 100 <i>pound</i> to any of them that shall
produce such a Bill. <i>Secondly</i>, This way will not
clog the <i>Patient</i> with more Medicines then are needful,
nor will omit anything may conduce to his recovery,
for if he fails in either, 'tis to his prejudice, either
in spending more Medicines which cost him money,
or in not performing his Cure, which loseth his
practice.
</p>

<p>
But I do not propose this course of mine as a general
rule to all <i>Physicians</i>, but leave this to every mans private
judgment; Neither do I hereby bind my self to
the same practice, because some few Cases may fall out
(though to an equal advantage to the <i>Patient</i>) may
perswade me to the contrary. For I find some persons
of that perswasion, as to think they have not given
satisfaction, unless they have payed for the Medicines;
but to such persons, I have always allowed them to
give me what they pleased themselves, for the cure
only, to the full satisfaction of both parties. Though
I will not deny but some persons out of gratitude for
their Cure, have rewarded me beyond this proposal.
Some of my acquaintance have desired me to be more

<a class="pb" name="35" id="png033"></a>

plain in this last Paragraph, especially in that part of
it where I say I do not bind my self to the said practice;
and to declare more fully the Cases that may
perswade me to the contrary; which are these and
such as these. <i>First</i> Where <i>Patients</i> of their own free
offers will contract with the <i><ins class="corr" title="2nd edition: Original has 'Physicians'">Physician</ins></i>, or have formerly
too meanly rewarded him for his Cure, in both
which the Statutes of our <i>College</i> allow a contract to
be made with <i>Patients</i>. Another case is, if a <i>Physician</i>
be consulted once, and for his Fee hath given Medicines
<i>gratis</i>, if the <i>Patient</i> frequently send for his Medicines
without the least reward at all. Or if the <i>Patient</i>
living far in the Country, having (as before) once
consulted the <i>Physician</i>, as in the last case, and shall for
weeks, nay months, send for the same Medicines. Or
if the <i>Patients</i> friend shall recommend a Medicine to
another friend of his unknown to the <i>Physician</i>; and
where he gives no Counsel, if a <i>Physician</i> in the Country
shall desire some of his Medicines, which are all the
cases that occur at present; I say in some of these, the
<i>Physician</i> must needs be payed for his Medicines; but
in other, 'tis rational he should be payed for his advice,
as he desireth new Medicines, which charge will be
far short also of the <i>Apothecaries</i> Medicines, whether
repeated or prescribed upon new advice.
</p>

<p>
Now the great charge of <i>Apothecaries</i> Bills, and
nauseousness of their Medicines, appears to be the
cause why long habitual diseases, as the Kings Evil,
Falling-Sickness, Convulsions, Melancholies, and
Winds in the Bowels, Gouts, <i>&amp;c.</i> become seldom relieved,
though they may with a constant, facile way,
be perfectly cured, where neither the great charge,

<a class="pb" name="36" id="png034"></a>

nor unpleasantness of Medicines, deterr them from a
continued necessary use of Remedies. And for the
same reasons many will be kept from relapses, who
being tired out with taking variety of Medicines, give
over before the tone and strength of their parts is
restored, which is necessary to be done in all long Diseases.
</p>

<p>
He may so contrive his Medicines, first, That they
may be taken in small quantity, and be made more
grateful to the tast, and stomach, and perform more
then those of the <i>Apothecaries</i>, commonly slovenly
made, and of themselves Fulsom, Nauseous, and Sluggish.
Secondly, His Medicines made for particular
persons, may last Weeks, Months, nay Years, whereas
the <i>Apothecaries</i> Drinks, especially in the Summer time,
must be renewed once, or twice every day, to the excessive
charge of the <i>Patient</i>.
</p>

<p>
That his Medicines may be fewer, is evident in <i>Physicians</i>
that practise in the Country, who ride far to <i>Patients</i>,
and carry in their Mans Cloak-bag, Medicines
enough, not only for the person he is sent to, but also
for most other persons, and Cases he meets with in his
Travels, and therefore his Closet needs contain but
few, yet noble and generous Medicines, and such as may
serve him upon all occasions, supplying what's defective
from the Fields or Gardens. He may avoid all pompous,
useless, chargable Medicines of the Shops, and
substitute in their place, cheaper, and more conducible
to health; He may very well lay aside the precious
Stones, Saphir, Emerals, <i>&amp;c.</i> the high priced Magistrals
of Coral, and Pearl, made worse by their preparations,
or rather destroyed thereby in their Virtue,

<a class="pb" name="37" id="png035"></a>

as also Unicorns Horn; and Bezoar, all which are now
rarely used alone, but in the received Compositions;
He may also spare the charges of leaf-gold, for guilding
Pots, Glasses, Pills, Electuaries, Boles, &amp;c. which
serves only to raise the Bill.
</p>

<p>
He may teach the <i>Patients</i> facile and easie Remedies,
as to make a Clyster, apply Blisters, or Medicines
to the feet, where they are needful, &amp;c. and in many
Cases may cure by well ordering his <i>Patient</i> only,
without any Remedies at all, or but very few; being
free to act for the <i>Patients</i> Health, without the grumbling
of the <i>Apothecary</i>; and many other ways he
may daily meet with, very advantageous to the
<i>Patient.</i>
</p>

<p>
He will have little use of Conserves, Syrups, Lohocks,
&amp;c. a greater part whereof Sugar makes up,
which doth more hurt to most persons, then the other
ingredients do good.
</p>

<p>
As for Infusions and Decoctions, he will find by experiment,
how much liquor, or <i>Menstruum</i> will suffice
to extract the full vertue of the ingredients, and
what are helps, or hinderances thereunto, and
thereby neither suffer loss in the quantity, or quality of
them.
</p>

<p>
He will discover the inefficacy of many of the Syrups
and other Medicines in the Shops, made of such
ingredients, the qualities whereof, what with boiling,
what with the great quantity of Sugar necessary to
keep them, are either made useless or opposite to the
ends they are proposed for. Especially in such Plants,
Seeds, and Flowers, which consist of fine volatil
parts, and even in drying and pounding, or the

<a class="pb" name="38" id="png036"></a>

least boiling exhale and evaporate, and therefore in the
common way of ordering them, lose their whole vertue
or most of their efficacy, and alter in their properties.
From which by several methods known to some
<i>Physicians</i>, very generous and singular Medicines may
be produced.
</p>

<p>
He need not use so large Compositions consisting of
such confused and contrary ingredients, and will find
good reason to lay aside those unintelligible and unreasonable
Compositions of Mithridate, and Treacle, and
the so much magnified Treacle-water, and will substitute
better in their places, of smaller charge, and less
trouble; and this all <i>Physicians</i> I have conversed with,
and the <i>College</i> it self, by their Book published for
the common good, in the year before the Plague,
and all those <i>Physicians</i> in this City, who make
or intend to make their own Medicines, do confess.
</p>

<p>
But here <i>Apothecaries</i> open wide, and cry out that
the <i>Physicians</i> are great Cheats, and envious persons,
for continuing such flat Medicines, and not recommending
to the World, or rather their Shops, our greater
secrets. The answer is easie, that the Medicines in our
<i>Pharmacopæa</i>, are the best of any other <i>Pharmacopæa</i>
in the World, both for their goodness, and well preparing
of them, whether they be Chymical, or Galenical;
and therefore the same scandal will ly on all
<i>Pharmacopæa's</i> whatsoever. <i>Secondly</i>, I say that within
these few last experimental years, the practical part
of Physic hath been much improved (as well as Anatomy)
especially by such as have put their hands to
work; and therefore till such improvement, this could

<a class="pb" name="39" id="png037"></a>

not be well amended. Furthermore, in making new
Dispensatories, a full content must be had, and 'twere
not fit to move where the motion were not like to
take place, for though private men invent new ways
of compounding and preparing, and using their own
invented Medicines, yet 'twill require a long time to
make them publickly known, and brought into common
use, and till that be done 'tis not possible to have
them brought into a common Dispensatory; besides,
no man would make a motion for such a reformation,
unless he were well furnished with specificks, and then
'twill be required of him to expose them to the whole
World, which how incongruous it will be, every man
may easily conceive; hereto add, that the <i>Apothecaries</i>
think themselves able enough by this present Dispensatory,
to out-beard <i>Physicians</i>, and do publickly
profess (as hath been said) that they understand the
practice of Physic well as they; how much more
would they have said so, if they had been made Masters
of these secrets? And here I shall admonish those
of my own Faculty, who have devoted their Studies,
Labours, and Purses, for the improvement of their
Art, to consider, that as natural things have their
bounds and limits, and that there is no new Creation
of them, and besides, that these things have their
bounds also of improvement, beyond which 'tis impossible
for man to go; and that by a good method
and industry, that end may be attained; (though at
present I must confess, no Art is more capable of enlargement
then ours:) I say let all consider, and they
will find, what a vast encouragement they have to improve
their knowledg so far, that they shall not only be

<a class="pb" name="40" id="png038"></a>

able to leave mankind destitute of no remedy Nature
did ever produce; but also restore and setle those
Honours ignorant men would usurp, upon the Learned
Professors of this Science, and I see no reason why
<i>Physicians</i> should communicate their secrets to such
persons, who will make use of them, to the ruine of
the Inventors, which is indeed a failer of trust, for
when a <i>Physician</i> writes his Bill, he trusts the <i>Apothecary</i>
only with making the Medicine for a particular
occasion, and not to make use of it as his own when be
pleaseth for his own profit, and the Inventor have no
further benefit by it, then perhaps one single advantage.
</p>

<p>
<i>Lastly</i>, When Dispensatories were first made, the
<i>Apothecaries</i> were really <i>Physicians</i> Servants, and
wholy at their command, not in the least intrenching
on their business, and the rates of Medicines were reasonable;
which superiority over them still continues
only in their prescriptions, the forms whereof are always
commanding to take this and that, and to mix
them, <i>&amp;c.</i> but within these few last years they have
set up for themselves, and advanced the rates beyond
all reason; and to be sure, the more we teach them
by our Books, the more they will trangress in
both.
</p>

<p>
He may receive encouragement from what he discovers,
that is more then ordinarily useful, whereas by
writing Bills, he soon communicates to the ignorant
and lazy, who will neither spend time nor money to
advance the Art, but while the one is at work to his
great charge, lots of time, much pains and trouble,
the others seek by petty tricks and Arts to gain a name,

<a class="pb" name="41" id="png039"></a>

and profit from the industrious. Nay some <i>Mountebanks</i>
have been set up by purchasing receipts of the
<i>Apothecary</i> or his Servants. And one of them told
me, he set up a <i>Quack</i> by selling and commending to
him a Medicine he had long kept in his Shop and could
not otherwise put off, and that by degrees he made
him a famous practiser among the ignorant and poor
people. An Act quite contrary to the interest of the
Company.
</p>

<p>
Hence also will arise an emulation amongst <i>Physicians</i>,
who shall exceed each other in noble remedies,
and from thence a full and happy improvement of
whatsoever God hath created for the recovery of mans
health impaired; for from the <i>Physician</i> alone the advancement
of Physic is to be expected. How many
simples of unknown properties have been brought into
use, to the great comfort of the sick? and many
more may be, as also many preparations, both simple
and compound, both in the Galenical, and Chymical
practice, and by this means the Art will be advanced
to its just dignity, now much diminished, dishonoured,
and near to be lost by the intrusion of ignorant
persons.
</p>

<p>
Greater respect will be given to such <i>Physicians</i>, as
being the immediate instruments of life and health,
who will derive unto themselves that which is now
given to the <i>Apothecaries</i>, which proceeds chiefly
from fear lest they should do the <i>Patient</i> hurt; and so
their honour will be doubled, which every <i>Physician</i>
looks principally at; but the <i>Apothecary</i> being not so
far concerned, looks chiefly at his own profit, and regards
not the <i>Patients</i> charge. For the greater the <i>Patients</i>

<a class="pb" name="42" id="png040"></a>

charge, the greater must needs be the <i>Apothecaries</i>
gain; whereas on the contrary, 'tis the <i>Physicians</i>
Interest to cure the <i>Patient</i> with the greatest
ease.
</p>

<p>
He may proceed on safely and securely in his well
experienced Medicines, having before him not only
what he hath prescribed for the same <i>Patient</i>, but for
all others in the like Case, and thereby keep in memory
what he would have forgot, if his Bill had remained
on the <i>Apothecaries</i> File; <i>viz.</i> the Medicines
and their success. By means whereof <i>Physicians</i> do
not advance their knowledg so far as they might; for
how is it possible they should remember the particulars
of their Bills writ some days before? and therefore
know not how to proceed so well. But the <i>Apothecaries</i>
having before them the whole series of Medicines,
brag they can do more then the <i>Physicians</i>,
and by this means insinuate the same opinion into
people.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Physician</i> will be consulted in the beginning of
Diseases, to the safety and little expence of the <i>Patient</i>,
who will not go first to the <i>Apothecary</i>, who practiseth
on him till the Case is desperate, and then calls in a
<i>Physician</i> when 'tis too late; and if he dyes, the <i>Physician</i>
must carry away the disgrace alone; but if he
recover, the <i>Apothecary</i> if he be so minded, by some
trick will share with him in the honour: and by this
resort of people to the <i>Apothecaries</i> in beginning of Diseases;
we meet with few Cases of easie Cure, but are
chiefly made use of in dangerous Diseases, or those of
short period, or such as are accompanyed with great
pains and torments, to our great and continual anxiety.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="43" id="png041"></a>

<p>
The <i>Physicians</i> experience hereby as 'tis surer, so
'twill be greater.
</p>

<p>
He will make use of no Medicines but the choicest,
and when they are in their full vigour, and such as are
durable, and after once or twice Tryal of them, will
seldom fail in his expected success; which cannot be
certainly had without some tryal.   For though a man
buy the choicest ingredients, <i>viz. Sena</i>, which may appear
to the Senses very good, yet he cannot positively
say, how well, nor yet what quantity of it will work,
till he hath made use of it.   But afterwards he may
confidently apply the whole parcel he hath bought to
his purpose.   The like may be instanced in a crop of
Wheat or Barley, which the skillfullest Husband-man
cannot tell how they will yield for Bread, or Malt, till
he hath used them.   Now how is it possible that a <i>Physician</i>
can with any certainty make use of several
Shops, since there is so great difference in the ingredients?
and 'tis certain the same Medicine made by several
<i>Apothecaries</i>, shall differ much in colour, smell,
and tast, and consequently effect too; which cannot
proceed from any other cause then the difference of
the ingredients themselves, or by omitting some ingredients,
or by substituting one thing for another;
or by distinct ways of preparing them. The same also
may be said of Compositions, much more of Chymical
Medicines so much sophisticated, and of so much
danger and hazard, if not well prepared, which he
cannot discover till he hath seen the effect of them,
unless it be such as he makes himself, nor those neither
till he hath made some tryal of them.
</p>

<p>
He will much inlarge <i>Materia Medica</i>, Chymistry

<a class="pb" name="44" id="png042"></a>

and Pharmacy, and discover the grounds of them, and
wherein the efficacy of remedies lyes, and thereby lay
open a whole Ocean for new discoveries, and by the
by observe many useful products and Phenomena of
Nature, to the great improvement of his Art, and
sound Natural Philosophy, which are not taken notice
of by <i>Apothecaries</i>, and their Servants; for all which
they have neither will nor skill.
</p>

<p>
As to the improvement of Medicines, this may be
added, by the experimenting <i>Physician</i>, that in distill'd
waters he will consider and find which of them
will afford any virtue, which only phlegm equivalent
but to Conduit-water, which of them will keep long,
and in perfection, which soon or in what time decay,
and spend them accordingly, and in compound distill'd
waters, will find cause to lay aside many simples
as nothing conducing, or rather weakning the efficacy
of the Medicine designed; whereby much charge
and trouble will be spared, and better compositions
be made.
</p>

<p>
He will gain and keep to himself <i>Patients</i>, who have
diseases they are unwilling should be known by <i>Apothecaries</i>
and their Boys, and all such as have a mind
to turn over their File.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Patient</i> will have better opinion of the Medicines,
and confidence in the use or them, and the <i>Physician</i>
more satisfied in his Conscience, and better
assured of the success.
</p>

<p>
He will gain reputation to his Art, by restoring it to
its first institution and practice, by the Founders and
Heroes of Physic.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="45" id="png043"></a>

<p>
'Tis convenient to adjoin here the old way of educating
young men into the practice of Physic, and surely
the safer for the Patients health; and I could wish 'twere
restored to its former usage, which was this. The Senior
<i>Physician</i> carried his Son, or such as he intended
to succeed him in his practice, along with him when he
visited his Patients, discovering, and discoursing with
them the disease, cause, method of cure, and what remedies
were fit to be applied to the present Case, and
to try them what they would do in that or the like
Case. And when his occasions would not permit him
to visit himself, he then sent one of his Scholars to inform
him of the condition of the sick person, and the
effect of his Medicines; and also when the said Scholars
had leisure, they were employ'd to help to gather,
prepare, and make, or oversee the compounding of
Medicines.  And such Scholars they call'd <i>filii Artis</i>,
sons of Art.   Some of the Professors in Foreign parts
practise the most of this to this very day, with such
Gentlemen as travel thither to study Physic, confirming
their reading with experience.
</p>

<p>
By constantly practised Medicines he will find out a
better method of Cure, and may hereby arrive at the
true causes of diseases.
</p>

<p>
He will observe what Medicines by precipitation
or other ways, alter, destroy, or weaken one another,
whereby of good ingredients singly used, a bad
Composition may be made, and therefore fail in the
success expected. Many more things might be here
added, which a skillful observer, and versed in the way
to make experiments (no easie matter) will daily find,
and at present I do not so much as give hints of them,

<a class="pb" name="46" id="png044"></a>

but shall hereafter, as occasion and opportunity require.
</p>

<p>
He will have more scope to be charitable to the poor,
and more civil and obliging to his friends, by curing
them <i>gratis</i>, or at small charges.
</p>

<p>
He need not trouble himself with ways of concealing
the use of his Medicines, by setting down no directions
in his Bill, but giving them to the <i>Patient</i>,
which the <i>Apothecary</i> soon learns; nor with giving
some of his own Medicines at a pinch, which if they
succeed not, to be sure the <i>Apothecaries</i> will cry down
in all places, but will conceal all eminently good successes,
as disadvantageous to themselves; nor by
placing their <i>Arcana's</i> in the Shops of those <i>Apothecaries</i>
they commonly make use of; nor by recommending
their <i>Patients</i> to such <i>Apothecaries</i> they
intrust their secrets with. For then great complaints
are made that the <i>Physicians</i> carry away their Customers,
and take away their livelyhood, affirming they are
willing to fetch them from the prescribing <i>Doctors Apothecaries</i>.
To which I answer, that they do fetch them,
but perhaps not always; since I have heard them often
say, these secrets were but the Medicines of the <i>London</i>
Dispensatory disguised under new names, to the
discredit of the <i>Physicians</i> that prescribed them. And
I well remember some of them have neglected to
fetch from my house, not far from their own, some of
my preparations, though they had them <i>gratis</i>, for the
fetching; whereby the <i>Patients</i> have suffered, and
thought I neglected them, 'till they were rectified by
another Visit. Nay one of them told me, he had rather
dy with his own Shop-Medicines, then be cured

<a class="pb" name="47" id="png045"></a>

with my Magistrals: much more would he have said of
<i>Patients</i>, manifestly preferring his own profit before
their lives; a most Unchristian saying!
</p>

<p>
One singular advantage such a <i>Physician</i> will have,
that the slanders of the <i>Apothecaries</i> will appear to be
malicious, as being raised against such as act contrary
to their profit.
</p>

<p>
By this means <i>Physicians</i> will unite against the common
Enemy, will contribute mutual assistance, and
communicate more freely to one another their practice
and remedies; and also the frauds and unlawful practices
of the <i>Apothecaries</i>, will conceal the counsels,
and act whatsoever may tend to the advance of their
Art; and <i>Patients</i> also will discover the <i>Apothecaries</i>
censures, and practices against the <i>Physicians</i> and their
prescriptions.
</p>

<p>
Hereby that great interest will decay <i>Apothecaries</i>
have in Families for their petty officiousnesses
(which <i>Physicians</i> not to displease them have put
them upon) these will be taught Nurses, and the
assistants, and which are by some of these as well,
certainly more diligently performed then by the <i>Apothecaries</i>.
</p>

<p>
Hereby the <i>filii Artis</i>, or younger <i>Physicians</i>, will
sooner come into a better and more setled practice,
and not be beholden to <i>Apothecaries</i> to bring them <i>Patients</i>
wherewith they often upbraid them, and glory
amongst themselves and to other persons, that they introduced
such and such a <i>Physician</i>.
</p>

<p>
Hereby <i>Chirurgeons</i> will be restored to some of their
employment now usurped by the <i>Apothecaries</i>, as leting
of blood, applying Leeches, Plasters, Cupping-Glasses,

<a class="pb" name="48" id="png046"></a>

Syringing and Salivation, wraping up bodies
in Cere-Cloaths, <i>&amp;c.</i> which indeed do more properly
belong to them then to the <i>Apothecaries</i>; hereby
also haply many occasions of quarrel betwixt <i>Physicians</i>
and the <i>Apothecaries</i> will cease, each party acting
according to his own way.
</p>

<p>
By this means Pseudochymists, and other <i>Mountebanks</i>
mouths and revilings will be stopped, only exclaiming
for this, that <i>Physicians</i> make not their own
Medicines. But since the publication of these papers
I am informed that the said Pseudochymists and <i>Mountebanks</i>
rail against me, this Book, and the way propounded,
as much as the <i>Apothecaries</i>, though before equal
Enemies each to others. So that they have fulfilled
the Proverb, of <i>like to like</i>. And no wonder since
hereby their Kingdom of darkness is brought to light,
and they are obliged to oppose it, as the Copper-Smiths
were to revile St. <i>Paul</i> for speaking against the Idol
of <i>Diana</i> of the <i>Ephesians</i>, whereby their trade was
lost.
</p>

<p>
And as for the reasonableness of it, that the <i>Physician</i>
ought to support himself by all lawful ways and means,
and to have præeminence above those ignorant persons
that incroach upon his profession, 'tis confessed by all
that have considered the great charge, study, and labour,
before he can arrive at any benefit from it; for
he must take the chargeable degrees of Batchellor, and
Master of Arts, Batchellor of Physic, and after 14
years standing, the degree of <i>Doctor</i>; besides his bare
expences for his maintenance in the University,
Charges in Anatomies, knowledg of natural things;
Travels abroad, Chymistry, and Experiments; his

<a class="pb" name="49" id="png047"></a>

Library, Habit, his more free way of living in a suitable
house, and Attendants, greater Taxes, <i>&amp;c.</i> insomuch
that a <i>Doctor</i> of Physic spends more before he
comes to practise, then will set up perhaps a dozen <i>Apothecaries</i>
in a way of livelihood; and besides, great
sums of money before he can put himself in a fitting
Equipage: whereas on the contrary, many young
men before their time of Apprenticeship is out, provide
well for themselves by Quacking; and certainly
the Study of Physic, and consequently the knowledge
of Nature, must bid farewel to the Universities, if
Shops be permitted to make practisers, for such the people
will soon create <i>Doctors</i>, which title the <i>Apothecary</i>
takes upon him, though he understand not the reason
of the name, to the great shame of the Universities,
and Faculty, when ignorant people shall give, and they
challenge the same title for nothing, attained by the
<i>Physician</i> at a great rate and long study, the vulgar taking
Practiser and <i>Doctor</i> to signifie the same thing.
And which no persons of knowledg and education do,
and perhaps most other persons give them in way of
Jeering.
</p>

<p>
From the handsom support of <i>Physicians</i> these benefits
will accrue to the publick, that thereby the honour
all Nations yield to the English <i>Physicians</i> will be kept
up, who in the late times, when the reputation of the
Nation was well neer forfeited abroad, the <i>Physicians</i>
then in being, most whereof are now living, and
Members of the <i>College</i>, maintained the credit, for
learning and value, of this Kingdom, and since his
Majesties happy return, some of them have kept up
the honour of the Faculty; which manifestly appears

<a class="pb" name="50" id="png048"></a>

by the great esteem Foreigners have of their Books,
by often printing them, and translating into Latin what
hath been published in English, though they are no
where so depressed as in <i>England</i>.
</p>

<p>
A second benefit to the publick is, that men of competent
Estates will breed up their Sons in the Art of
Physic, giving them such education as is necessary, and
will not vouchsafe to place them out to <i>Apothecaries</i>,
though now adays want of learning and degrees are
adjudged as needful a qualification for the exercise of
Physic, as formerly 'twas for Preaching, and the Shops
fit to supply both.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude this part of my discourse with this
observation; that the Laws of <i>England</i> in all their Acts
of Parliament, have granted the practice of Physic
to <i>Physicians</i> and them alone, and in no clause thereof
put in any restraint at all upon them, but every where,
either new priviledges, or a confirmation of the old,
have been granted, by the said powers. Whereas on
the contrary, the Law supposeth cheats in the <i>Apothecaries</i>
Shops, and therefore impowers our <i>Censors</i> to
destroy and burn what they find bad and corrupt.
</p>

<p>
The next thing to be treated of, shall be the ways of
<i>Apothecaries</i> creeping into practice, and their unfitness
thereunto. As to the first, heretofore when they were
Members of the Company of Grocers, and dispersed
in place, as well as in counsel, they then were wholy
subordinate to the <i>Physicians</i>, only keeping in their
Shops, and faithfully making the prescriptions they
received from the <i>Physicians</i>, and when made, sending
them to the <i>Patient</i> by their men (as they still continue
to do in Foreign Countries) and not committing the

<a class="pb" name="51" id="png049"></a>

preparation to raw Boys, or Apprentices, which is the
true interest of the <i>Patient</i> they should do here likewise.
But in process of time, <i>Physicians</i> in acute diseases
having taught them somewhat, sent them to visit
their <i>Patients</i>, to give them the best account they
could of the estate of their health, and effect of their
Medicines. And of later years some <i>Physicians</i> took
them along with them in their Visits, whereby they
acquired a little smattering of diseases, by which
means, and their continual officiousness, they insinuated
themselves into Families, and by applying (right
or wrong) the terms of Art they had learned from
the <i>Physicians</i>, they made people believe they had acquired
some skill in the Art, and afterwards began to
venture a little at practice, and but until these 10 years
last past kept themselves within some bounds and limits;
but since that time have daily more and more
incroached upon our Profession, being assisted by a
greater familiarity of conversation with younger <i>Physicians</i>.
And in the Plague time they took upon them
the whole Practice of Physic, which ever since they
have continued, being much helped also therein by the
dispersing of <i>Physicians</i> into places unknown to their
<i>Patients</i>, by the Fire, but above all by the burning of
the <i>College</i>, by means whereof their Government and
view of their Shops have been omitted, insomuch that
now they are past all restraint, having insinuated and
(as they think) rooted themselves by the aforesaid
Artifices, so that there remains now no other real remedy
but that proposed.
</p>

<p>
Now here I shall take occasion in a short digression,
to discourse briefly the reason, why in all Ages there

<a class="pb" name="52" id="png050"></a>

have been so many pretenders to Physic, and why
some of them have got reputation in the World. One
hath been mentioned before, <i>viz.</i> the great charges
sick men are put to, caused by the separation of the
<i>Physician</i> from the <i>Apothecary</i>. But the principal reason
is, the want of knowledge in most persons, both of the
materials used, and the grounds for which they are
applyed. Insomuch that there are but few that can
judg, and distinguish rightly of either, and no wonder
therefore that in their reasonings they commit
more absurd mistakes, or Paralogisms then in any
other Art whatsoever, and censure <i>Physicians</i> by the
success alone. Which my Lord <i>Verulam</i> accounts
the great unhappiness both of the States-man and the
<i>Physician</i>, both being alike censured by those that
know not the bottom and rise of their Actions and
Counsels. For how can any man in either make a
sound Judgment without a full knowledge of the business
it self; and of all the circumstances thereunto
belonging; nor in Physic without the concurrent
knowledg of the sick mans habit, disease, cause, remedies,
and many other particulars necessary to make
a clear judgment upon the success? Yet notwithstanding,
many will censure and grumble at the actions of
the States-men, though their proceedings have been
never so wise, and prudent, and oft-times from muttering
and whispering, fall to down-right distast, and mutiny
against their Superiors. So that the good success,
in State-affairs, of rash and imprudent undertakers,
have been extolled and preferred before the wary,
and prudent management, and guidance of the soberest
and wisest States-men. The same likewise

<a class="pb" name="53" id="png051"></a>

happens between the bold <i>Empiric</i>, and learnedst <i>Physician</i>.
But in this way of censuring, the States-man
hath this advantage above the <i>Physician</i>, that 'tis
possible he may meet with a series of Business so circumstantiated,
as seldom or never to miscarry, especially
having a greater power over subordinate persons
then <i>Physicians</i> have. But the irreversible statute
of Heaven forbids us to expect a constant recovery of
our <i>Patients</i>, for 'tis appointed, that all men must die. 'Tis
sufficient therefore for us, to employ those remedies
God hath given to the Sons of men, to the utmost
vertue the Creator hath endowed them withal: since
his eternal decree hath limited their efficacy from making
man immortal. Now since (if men judg by the
success alone) it cannot be otherwise, but that the most
learned <i>Physician</i>, and most sottish <i>Empiric</i> must be
thought equal in skill, by those that are not able to
make a right judgment and difference betwixt them
on other principles. Hence it comes to pass, that
where some ignorant person hath cured accidentally
a slight disease, and a <i>Physician</i> hath a <i>Patient</i> dye of an
irrecoverable Case, here the <i>Empiric</i> shall be applauded,
and the <i>Physician</i> decryed. Nay many will say
the disease is the same in both, whereas we daily see
most gross mistakes in such opinions, when the Cases
differ totally in their Nature, agreeing in one sign only
common to both the Cases proposed, nay to many
other also. Furthermore, if a <i>Patient</i> dy under an
<i>Empirics</i> hand, the friends willingly conceal their
Names, lest some discredit should befal them for using
such worthless practisers; but if under the hands of
a known <i>Physician</i> he shall be sure to be named, and

<a class="pb" name="54" id="png052"></a>

sometimes his attendance falsly fathered on him, when
<i>Mountebanks</i> only have been employed: but to besure
if an <i>Empiric</i> hath first been made use of, and afterwards
an able <i>Physician</i> called in (when all opportunity
of doing good was past) and the <i>Patient</i> dy, the
<i>Mountebank</i> hath never been mentioned, but the <i>Physician</i>
perhaps condemned though he hath done whatsoever
could have been thought on, rational in that Case.
</p>

<p>
Add to the former reasons, the bold and confident
brags, and promises of <i>Empirics</i>, that they have cured
worse diseases, and will in few hours free them from
their maladies, especially where sober <i>Physicians</i> have
pronounced doubtfully of the event. No wonder
that these pleasing promises to persons in danger and
distress bring them into employment even with a rejection
of the former sober <i>Physician</i>.
</p>

<p>
Besides, a foolish opinion prevails with some ignorant
persons, that they will deal only with such as will
undertake the Cure, (that is) contract with them for
a sum of money, one half whereof to be payed in hand,
and the other the Cure being done, and so are usually
cheated of one half of their money; and such people
will have nothing to do with such <i>Physicians</i> as
will not undertake them in this sence.
</p>

<p>
Another Stratagem is, to give strange and hard
names to their Medicines, such as are <i>Pilulæ radiis
Solis extractæ</i>, and in English is no more then Pills
dryed to that consistence by the Sun-Beams, which
ignorant people have thought were made of the Sun
Beams. Others commend their Extract of the Soul
of the Heathen Gods. One sets up with a receipt received
from <i>Van Helmonts</i> own hands; Another hath

<a class="pb" name="55" id="png053"></a>

received from a Jew the shining of <i>Moses</i> Face; nay I
have heard a Pseudochymist blasphemously brag, he
saw in the making of a grand <i>Elixir</i>, the Quintessence
of the Trinity in Unity, and infinite other pitiful captivations
of silly people, to be seen on every Gate and
Post of this City; such as are the Spirit of the Salt of
the World, <i>Panchymagogon</i>, and other ten-footed
Greek names, and some other Mongrel non-sensical
ones compounded of several Languages; promising
certain, speedy, and concealed Cure of incurable Diseases.
</p>

<p>
And no less ridiculous and absurd to considering
persons are, their cantings of themselves, wherewith
they no less befool, amuse, and beguile the people;
as that by long prayer, and seeking of God, they have
had many secrets revealed to them from Heaven.
Another by long Travels through <i>Hungary</i>, <i>Poland</i>,
&amp;c. hath attained great secrets from Kings and Emperours.
Another a Gentleman lately come from <i>Oxford</i>,
or <i>Cambridg</i>, Cures the Pox, Running of the
Reins, &amp;c. in Capital Letters, at all which what
sober man cannot but laugh? Yet such as these are inducements
to many to resort to them; moreover some
of them are Astrologers, Physiognomers, Fortunetellers,
Professors of Palmistry and such other vain
Arts; much applauded by the weaker sort of people.
</p>

<p>
Besides, the former they have their Emissaries,
Scouts, and Setters up and down, to cry up the skill
And feigned Cures done by them, Nurses, Good-fellows,
Midwives, <i>&amp;c.</i>  to make up the cry and full
noise.
</p>

<p>
Now it being natural to most people to admire what

<a class="pb" name="56" id="png054"></a>

they understand not, and for Admiration to infer Love,
and Love Praise, and Praise the use especially of such
things as are set off with high and lofty expressions, it
necessarily follows that such persons will cry up, and
make use of, those that by these means captivate their
understandings, especially their credits being ingaged
also; but above all, if they proceed from meaner
persons, of whom they are most credulous, having in
suspition wiser men, believing the former are not able,
and that the wiser are able; and therefore will deceive
them. All which appears in some with us cryed
up above any <i>Physician</i> that ever was in <i>England</i>,
though for pitiful, dangerous, nay sometimes mortal
Medicines, whereby great sums of money have been
gained in a short time; I shall instance first in <i>Lockyers</i>
Pills made of <i>Antimony</i>, discovered to be so by some of
my <i>Collegues</i>, and my self, at the first selling of them.
A Medicine as ill made as any of that Mineral, and no
<i>Physician</i> though meanly versed in Chymistry, but
could have excelled it.   Yet so great a Vogue this Pill
had for some time, that infinite people resorted to him,
and purchased them for their lives, both for themselves,
and Families, and (as I have heard) for their
posterities too.   Though a common Chimney in a
little time would have made enough of it to have
served the whole Nation for some years to come, and
that at very small charges. But Experience, the Tutor
of too many, hath in a short time brought these Pills
into a dis-use, if not a total Oblivion, even amongst
the vulgar.
</p>

<p>
A second cryed up Medicine was <i>Mathews</i>'s Pills,
made of <i>Opium</i> (to which the virtue of the whole

<a class="pb" name="57" id="png055"></a>

Composition must be attributed) of white <i>Hellebor</i>
Roots, and Oyl of <i>Turpentine</i>, whereto some add Salt of
<i>Tartar</i>, which will puzzle the most knowing Naturalist
to declare why these should be thus jumbled together;
unless to obscure the <i>Opium</i>. 'Tis indeed a very cunning
Composition, for by giving rest and ease it may easily
decoy people into the use of them, though by long
taking of them, diseases become far more uncurable
then they are in their own Nature.
</p>

<p>
A third Universal Medicine was <i>Hughes's</i> Powder,
sold by him at 10 <i>s.</i> the Grain, and 3 <i>l.</i> 10 <i>s.</i> the Dose,
made doubtless of Gold and Quicksilver. The tast
and weight of it manifestly discover the former to be
an ingredient into it, and the effect, <i>viz.</i> Salivation
proves the latter to be part of the compound.   Besides
I have made of these two dissolved, and digested in
their peculiar Menstruums, in no long space of time, a
Medicine that had the same effect with his, and in the
same Dose, and having a View of his Cabinet left
after his Death, containing a large quantity of the said
Powder (being all he left behind him) there was found
crude Gold, and Quicksilver in the same Cabinet.
Now these three Notorious Universal Medicines
were put to sale by most ignorant persons. Add hereunto
the forementioned <i>Mr. De-laun's</i> Pill, whereof I
shall say nothing, being mentioned under the Name of
the <i>Pilule ex duobus</i>, in the <i>London Dispensitory</i>, though
some make them of the Extract of <i>Coloquintida</i>. The
last of any Fame with us, were Dr. <i>Goddard's</i> Drops,
a good Medicine, but not so universal, and superlative
as he would have made the World believe, and
was nothing else but what some <i>Physicians</i> many years

<a class="pb" name="58" id="png056"></a>

since enjoyed. I well remember that in the late
troubles, a Person then in great Authority, having
cryed up this above all the Medicines in the World,
a round wager was offered, that the <i>Doctor</i> should not
distinguish his own from two others that should be
brought him, both which were but Spirit of <i>Harts-horn</i>.
But the wager would not be accepted of.
Furthermore, that this Medicine of his was Spirit of
<i>Harts-horn</i>, some relations plainly argue; One whereof
was the following.
</p>

<p>
A certain person in <i>Norfolk</i> having sent for as much
as came to a 11 <i>l.</i> and dying upon the 2d. dose of it,
and by accident most part of the remainder being
spilt; there comes in a friend to the House, of some
skill, who supposing it to be Spirit of <i>Harts-horn</i>, told
the Widow he would endeavour to gain back the
money for her. And thereupon went to a Chymist,
and bought as much of the said Spirit, as would make
up the quantity purchased of Dr.&nbsp;<i>Goddard</i>, who after
Tryal of it by smell, and tast, acknowledged it to be
his, and honestly payed back the sum 'twas first sold
for; which I think few of the <i>Mountebanks</i> do. Sure
I am that a Quack sold 21 Pills for 20 <i>l.</i> whereof the
<i>Patient</i> took 4 at two doses, to the great hazard of
his life, who then repairing to me for my advice, I by
Tryal of one of them found them to be Mercurial, and
wished him to return them back, but the Quack would
not give him 10 <i>s.</i> for the 16 remaining.
</p>

<p>
The inference and sum of what hath been said, is to
shew briefly by what Artifices people are deceived in
their Healths, and Purses, and how easily the ignorant
are couzened, and such practices used, that <i>Physicians</i>,

<a class="pb" name="59" id="png057"></a>

men of honesty and repute, would be ashamed to own,
and must by using them in a short time be ruined and
discredited. And such Cheats as these, the <i>College</i> of
<i>Physicians</i> are bound by the Laws of the Land to decry,
and punish (though by so doing it hath often incurred
the censure and clamor of the vulgar) Besides the Statute
of the 14<i>th.</i> and 15<i>th.</i> of <i>Henry</i> the Eighth injoyns
us to it, declaring that 'tis good for the Common-wealth
of this Realm, and therefore expedient,
and necessary to provide that no person of the <i>College</i>
of <i>Physicians</i> (for all practisers then were of the said
body) be suffered to exercise, and practise Physic,
but only those persons that be profound, sad, and discreet,
groundly learned, and deeply studyed in Physic.
Now certain it is, that none of the said body did
or dare use any of the forementioned frauds and deceits,
but will constantly indeavour (since 'tis impossible
but there will be Cheatees; (according to the old
Proverb, <i>Populus vult decipi</i>, <i>The People will be deceived</i>)
to abridge the number of the Cheaters,
who answer to the former part of the Proverb, <i>Decipiatur</i>,
<i>Let them be couzened</i>.
</p>

<p>
I shall end this discourse by returning from my digression
to the <i>Apothecaries</i>, who may and do use some
of the tricks before-mentioned, and shall here briefly
recite some great advantages they have, and
make use of above <i>Physicians</i>. One is, that they live
in this City 7 or 8 years as <i>Apprentices</i>, as also by
their retail Trade, and by living in open Shops, by
frequent converse with their fellow Citizens, whether
in Commerce or Offices, by many friendly and Neighbourly
mutual kindnesses and actions, wherein they

<a class="pb" name="60" id="png058"></a>

spend their whole lives, and are never diverted by studies,
and ingenuity from their proposed way of gain,
by all which means they get into a fixed familiarity
and good opinion with their Neighbours, and a large
acquaintance in the World. Now for their skill, besides
what hath been before-mentioned, and common
to them with the <i>Mountebank</i>, <i>viz.</i> Vapouring and
braging of their skill, and decrying <i>Physicians</i>, by talking
above the Capacity of those they converse with,
who therefore take all they say to be authentick,
though never so absurd, and trivial, and many times to
set off themselves they will venture to speak Latine
commonly as false as the matter, although some of
them at <i>Coffee-Houses</i>, and in other mixt Companies, by
venturing so boldly have been met with and baffled,
and made to depart thence with shame and discredit
enough, which their friends and acquaintance take
little notice of. Add hereunto their exposing to view
their Compositions of <i>Treacle</i>, <i>Mithridate</i>, <i>Diascordium</i>
and <i>Alkermes</i>, which all their friends, and neighbours
one time or another must see; (being set off by
some very curiously) and seeing cannot but admire the
great charge, art, and labour of the <i>Apothecary</i>, and
perhaps hear his learned Lecture upon them, whereby
they imply their great skill, knowledg in the virtues of
these ingredients, and consequently an ability to practise
with them; all which are below the dignity
of a <i>Physician</i>; and therefore a long time is necessary
for him to gain acquaintance, wanting the
fore-mentioned opportunities the <i>Apothecaries</i> enjoy.
<i>Lastly</i>, Their painted Pots and Glasses, with false

<a class="pb" name="61" id="png059"></a>

Titles on them, more win the vulgar then a <i>Physicians</i>
Library of far greater value.
</p>

<p>
As to their incapacity for Practice, 'tis manifest by
their education, and ignorance of all those things
which are required in an able <i>Physician</i>, <i>viz.</i> the knowledg
of Arts and Languages; by the former whereof
men learn the way and rules of observing, and improvements
to be made thereon; by the latter, what
the learned searchers of Nature have in all Ages taken
notice of, necessary, and little enough in an Art
so difficult as that of Physic. They are wholy ignorant
also of all Philosophy, and the very Elements of
the Art, and therefore unskillful in knowing diseases;
and more surely their causes, whereto respect is
to be had, as well as to the diseases, to which, fit
remedies are to be applyed. For want of Anatomy
know neither the part affected, nor how 'tis affected;
much lets any thing of Chirurgical directions. And
through their ignorance in Philosophy, and Arts, they
have not skill enough to advise a diet sutable to diseases;
a thing most necessary, as well in curing diseases
as in preserving of health, and which requires a great
insight into the nature of things; nor the true grounds
and reasons of compounding, practising their way rather
by rote then by rule; with better reason may a
Brick-layer or Carpenter pretend to be a Mathematical,
or a Common Fidler to be a Musick Reader in
the Universities, or <i>Gresham-College</i>, since both these
have the practical part of those Sciences, which
<i>Apothecaries</i> have not in Physic, in the least measure.
</p>

<p>
And to conceal their mis-actings, they generally do

<a class="pb" name="62" id="png060"></a>

all by word of mouth, and not enter their prescriptions
into their Books, being haply ashamed
any knowing men should discover their sins of omission,
as dangerous many times in point of life and
health, as those of their commission. Whereas <i>Physicians</i>
Bills are on the File, or registred in Order in their
own Books, which is their justification from all
misrepresentations.
</p>

<p>
Again, they sufficiently confess their ignorance, by
calling in <i>Physicians</i> when their own, or any of their
relations healths are concerned, and the same all people
acknowledge, when they are in distress and danger.
And very few understanding persons, and none
that are learned and knowing, will trust them at all.
But I shall refer the Reader to the forementioned
Writer against the <i>Apothecaries</i>, <i>viz.</i> Dr. <i>Daniel Coxe</i>,
who permitted me to name him here; by whom this
and many other things here but briefly touched, are
judiciously handled, and more largely.
</p>

<p>
And as for their skill in practice, we daily see their
gross errours and omissions, being called where they
have given Medicines. I shall instance only in one
that hapned at the writing hereof; <i>viz.</i> that an
<i>Apothecary</i> gave strong Purging Pills on the Fit day
of a gentle Quartan Ague, which turned it into a
violent Fever, to the great hazard of the <i>Patients</i>
life.
</p>

<p>
And at how easie rate they practise, many of their
Bills brought and complained of to our <i>College</i>, (in
some whereof I have seen Fees set down for Visits)
witness, wherein upon a slight disease 5 <i>l.</i> hath
been demanded for four days practice. And I have

<a class="pb" name="63" id="png061"></a>

heard one of them brag, that he commonly had from
20 to 100 <i>l.</i> besides presents, for cure of a Clap
(as they call it) which  might have been more
speedily and securely performed for a manifold lesser
sum.
</p>

<p>
I now come to answer some slight objections; as
first, that <i>Physicians</i> are unskillful in the Art of making
Medicines; but sure those that thus object cannot
deny them that ability which Ladies, and almost
all ordinary women have; <i>viz.</i> of distilling of waters
of all sorts, making of Syrups, Conserves, Preserves,
Powders, Trochiscs, Electuaries (and what not) and
as many think, more cleanly and neatly then the <i>Apothecaries</i>;
and some of them Ointments, and Plasters,
in which two lyes their main skill. Some whereof,
to those that understand not the way of dissolution
of bodies, and the nature of their mixture may
be difficult. Yet this defect they may supply by
lessening the number of ingredients, and may
perform more with 2, or 3 Simples, then with the
larger Compositions, as 'tis manifest in the use of
<i>Galbanum</i> alone, now used and found better then
<i>Emplastrum Hystericum</i>, consisting of 21 ingredients.
</p>

<p>
And though as matters now stand, <i>Physicians</i> have
not the honour to be counted superiour to <i>Apothecaries</i>
in their Art, yet every one knows that they alone are
the prescribers and directors of the <i>Apothecaries</i> in
what they know; and are able to puzzle them in infinite
things that concern their Trade, besides in Chymical
preparations, whereof most of them are totally
ignorant; and should <i>Physicians</i> withdraw themselves

<a class="pb" name="64" id="png062"></a>

from their conversation, few pretenders to Physic
would appear more unskillful then they, neither knowing
how to deal with a new Simple, nor a new disease.
And for all their pretences of skill in Drugs, 'tis most
certain that the State makes <i>Physicians</i> not <i>Apothecaries</i>,
Judges of them; and the Statute of <i>Henry</i> the
VIII. appoints the <i>College</i> Censors upon Oath, not the
<i>Apothecaries</i> to judg, and condemn false and sophisticated
Medicines.
</p>

<p>
A second objection wherewith they flatter themselves,
is, that the great expence of time in preparing
Medicines will keep <i>Physicians</i> from this course. I
answer, that the <i>Physician</i> needs not spend much more
then half an hour in a day, one with another, on this
work, and may faster dispense them then the <i>Apothecaries</i>
to Hospitals, who in an afternoon can provide for
100, nay sometimes 200 sick men, and carry them to
the Hospital, and dispose them to each single person,
which takes up much time, which the <i>Physicians</i> Servants
need not be put to.
</p>

<p>
A third objection is, that this course, which before
'twas put in practice they derided, now used is railed
at, will undo them. I answer that if needs, one or
the other must be ruined, 'tis more reasonable that the
<i>Apothecary</i> should suffer then the <i>Physician</i>, because the
one acts but his duty, and for the publick good, but
the other are transgressors of the Law, and act above
the Sphere of their skill, and do many prejudices to
the precious lives, and healths of men; and the rather,
because 'tis in their own power to prevent this mischief,
by stinting the number of their Servants (as 'tis
in foreign parts, and in <i>England</i> also, in very many if

<a class="pb" name="65" id="png063"></a>

not most other Trades. Nay our State allows but
a set number of Printers) for they acknowledg themselves,
that the exceeding increase of their number
must necessarily in a short time bring them all to shifting
and beggery, and a greater want of skill then what
they now pretend to. But to answer this Objection
more fully, I affirm <i>Apothecaries</i> have made and do
make use of several other ways of subsistence; besides
their bare trades (none of which <i>Physicians</i> can
use) <i>viz.</i> some of them in this City as well as in the
Country, sell Grocery-wares, and by both together,
gain Estates. <i>Secondly</i>, They barter in Drugs and
other Commodities, selling them amongst themselves,
and to other Tradesmen. Furthermore, they are now
building a Laboratory to make all sorts of Chymical
Medicines, intending to supply the whole Nation with
them, which must necessarily undo all the Chymists in
<i>London</i>; and whether in time they will not distil
Strong-waters, <i>&amp;c.</i> (an easie thing for them to undertake)
and by this means to ruine the Corporation
of Distillers of Strong-waters, I leave to the said Company
to conceive as they please. However, this I have
heard several of them say, that they resolve to buy
all sorts of Drugs, and make a Magazine of them, as
well as of the greater Compositions, at their own Hall;
and to sell them to the Members of their Company,
whereby the Trade of the Druggist, must be much
lessened, if not totally over-thrown. So little regard
have they of any other employment but of their own,
yet all these things they may do without any offence
against the Laws of the Land. Why then should they,
who have so many ways of subsistence, envy, and

<a class="pb" name="66" id="png064"></a>

usurp unlawfully over the single and lawful way granted
<i>Physicians</i> for their livelihood? Or why would
they repine, and revile them for advancing their Art,
the publick health and profit, and for maintaining their
profession by their Pens, and actings against themselves,
who are the first aggressors in this division? Which I
profess to be the sole end of these present papers, and
heartily wish they may thrive and prosper as long as
they conform themselves to the Laws of Honesty,
Reason, and of the Land. Besides, why may not the
Plaisterer more reasonably pretend the same to the
Painter, and many other Trades against one another,
as the Brick-layer to the Stone-Cutter, <i>&amp;c.</i> that they
understand the Trade, and that truly too, and that
they cannot subsist without this incroachment? And
why should not <i>Chirurgeons</i> keep open <i>Apothecaries</i>
Shops? but that the same Law limits those Tradesmen,
as well as prohibits the <i>Apothecary</i> from the practice
of Physic. And surely the Law and State have
no consideration of those persons subsistence, who
conform not to them; and why should we have of
those, subordinate to us, who against all good Conscience
take away from us all that is our due, and
continually traduce and slander us very untruly and
designingly?
</p>

<p>
The last objection (and a strange one) is, that in this
private way of giving Medicines, <i>Physicians</i> may poyson
their <i>Patients</i>. But this is easily retorted upon the
<i>Apothecaries</i>, who may themselves or their Servants
do the like, as 'tis known in the poysoning of Sir <i>Thomas
Overbury</i>; besides, since it cannot be otherwise, but that
the <i>Patient</i> must trust somebody, 'tis better to trust one

<a class="pb" name="67" id="png065"></a>

then many; and if one, better him whose education
will teach him better Morality, (and who hath given
his Faith (equivalent to an Oath) twice to the Body
of the <i>College; viz.</i> once at his admission as Candidate,
and a second time at his admission as Fellow; whereby
he promiseth in these words, That he shall give nothing
to cause miscarriage, or to destroy, or hinder
Conception, nor Poysons (for of such, good Medicines
may be made) to an evil purpose, nay that he shall
not even teach them where there is any suspicion of
ill using of them. Which promise is nothing else but
the Oath proposed by <i>Hippoc.</i> to <i>Physicians</i>, in the entrance
to his Books) <ins class="corr" title="2nd edition: Original has 'then'">then to trust</ins> such as want these qualifications;
and this seems to be the reason why our Common
Law makes it Felony, for any person to have any one
dy under his hand, unless he were a lawful <i>Physician</i>.
More noble and generous was the opinion of <i>Alexander</i>
the Great, concerning his <i>Physician</i>, who confidently
drank off that Medicine which cured him,
though he was before informed by some friend that
'twas poysoned. Neither can History it self to my
knowledg produce any example, that ever any such
foolish Villany was acted; Though doubtless many
lives might have been saved if the <i>Apothecaries</i> would
have complyed with the <i>College</i>, in their proposed Orders
for selling <i>Rats-bane</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the next place I shall recite some few of their devices
against those <i>Physicians</i> in particular that make
their own Medicines, as to tell the <i>Patient</i> that is
averse to Chymical Medicines, that the <i>Doctor</i> is Chymical,
and that because forsooth he makes his own Medicines;
but to those that affect Chymical, that the

<a class="pb" name="68" id="png066"></a>

<i>Doctor</i> is but a Galenist, and useth only dull and ineffectual
remedies, as best suits to the sick mans Palat.
A second is, that if this <i>Physician</i> be called in to
a <i>Patient</i>, the <i>Apothecary</i> will pretend present danger,
and in his absence call in another, or pretend he is
abroad when he is not, or else that the Case requires
the counsel of two <i>Physicians</i>; and what other devices
they use, I have not well learned.
</p>

<p>
Now briefly follow some small Scandals they cast
upon the said <i>Physicians</i>, as first that they do it for
want of practice; the falsity whereof is known by
those few that do act this way already, and shortly
'twill be more apparent, when many more of good
practice, singular parts and honesty will do the like,
and certainly nothing but lazyness, ignorance, or want
of will to do the utmost good they are able for the sick,
can hinder them from so doing, except age, infirmity
of body, or want of convenience. But suppose 'tis
so as they alledg, doubtless every man may and ought
to use all lawful means for his own subsistence; and do
not our adversaries say they are inforced to it, affirming
that unless they give Medicines of themselves,
their acquaintance will go to another <i>Apothecary</i> who
will do it, though one of their Company told me,
they had power by their Charter to restrain practice?
Whence (if true) it clearly follows that the whole
Company allows it.
</p>

<p>
But those <i>Physicians</i>, that for the reasons above,
cannot nor will not take this course, are to be admonished,
to do here as the <i>Physicians</i> did in <i>France</i>,
for the good of people, <i>viz.</i> to tell their <i>Patients</i> the
prices of Medicines, and to write their Bills in English,

<a class="pb" name="69" id="png067"></a>

that thereby the <i>Patients</i> may not pay too unreasonable
for them.
</p>

<p>
I now conclude, having performed this ungrateful
task, with as much brevity, mildness of Spirit, and language,
as the business would permit (and what the
prudent Statutes of our <i>College</i> require of each of their
members, that we shall by all honest and lawful ways
and means prosecute all illiterate <i>Mountebanks</i> and Impostors,
<i>&amp;c.</i> and is no more then the Laws and Charters
granted to us allow, and what we twice faithfully promise
(as much an Oath as we can give) <i>viz.</i> at our admission
as Candidate and as Fellow) being obliged to
another work of greater difficulty, and concern, long
since promised, having been too long diverted with fitting
my self for my intended practice, and several other
unavoidable Occasions.

<h2>Postscript.</h2>
<p>
<i>Reader</i>, There intervening so small a space from
the publication of the first Edition of these
Papers to this second; I thought to have added
nothing to it, but to have put it out only more
correct, as the Title intimates; but since some Sheets
were printed off, I have had the opportunity to be informed
of some exceptions taken to them, which being
but few, I shall give the Objectors full satisfaction
in. Though one answer might serve for all; <i>viz.</i> that
an <i>Apothecary</i> in the presence of two <i>Physicians</i>, said,
that he had told me of all these Cheats, and indeed they
are so common, that whosoever shall be conversant
with them, may observe most of these to be a great
part of their discourse. The First exception against
<i>Myrtle-leafs</i>, that they were not shewed the <i>Censors</i>
for <i>Sena</i>, a Binder for a Purger; the time I have
forgot; the <i>Censors</i> then were, Sir <i>George Ent</i>, Dr.
<i>Goddard</i>, Dr. <i>King</i>, and my Self; the places, <i>Tut-hill-street</i>,
and some Shops in <i>King-street</i>; Mr. <i>Shellberry</i>
being then Master of the Company. Secondly, As
for <i>Mushrooms</i> rubbed over with Chalk for <i>Agaric</i>;
this was found by the <i>Censors</i> in the <i>Old-Baily</i>, at the
Shop of one now dead, and therefore I shall say no
further of it, it being taken notice of by Mr. <i>Evelyn</i>,
as is intimated before. <i>p.</i>8. A Third is <i>Diascordium</i> made
of <i>Honey</i> and <i>Bole-Armeniac</i>, this was discovered in a

<a class="pb" name="71" id="png069"></a>

Shop at the end of <i>Drury-lane</i> near <i>Holborn</i>, concluded
to be so by Sir <i>George Ent</i>, <i>My Self</i>, and Mr. <i>Richardson</i>
then Master of the Company, and the rest of
the <i>Censors</i> and <i>Wardens</i>, easily to be remembred, and
was by them taken away to their Hall; a pound
whereof I had, and by dissolution found it to be no
otherwise; what the <i>Apothecaries</i> did with the large
Pot of the remainder I know not. Besides these, I
have heard no exception to the whole concerning
frauds.
</p>

<p>
Now since the Cheaters with the Cheatees, most
insist on the objection of Poyson; I add to what hath
been formerly said; that Poysons are not necessarily
to be given in Medicines alone, but may be given in
Broaths, Beer, or any other thing taken into the Body,
and that without the consultation or knowledg of any
<i>Physician</i>, and surely if any one had a mind to Poyson
his Relations (an Action abominable to the English
Nation) he would rather Act privately himself, having
many opportunities offered to him, rather then
by communicating it to others, make himself obnoxious
to their discovery. But if he should communicate
to others, 'tis more probable he would communicate
it to meaner, and more Mercenary persons, as
<i>Apothecaries</i> and Nurses, at a smaller rate and with
more security, then reveal such secrets to <i>Physicians</i>,
Men of Honour, and Honesty. Furthermore, if any
mans life be suspected to be taken away with Poyson,
and by opening the body it should appear so (and
without which it cannot well appear) the <i>Physician</i> is
doubtless as lyable to the Law as any other person
whatsoever. So that the <i>Patient</i> hath as much moral

<a class="pb" name="72" id="png070"></a>

security from this mischief, as possibly can be had, or
wished in humane affairs. Nay suppose the <i>Physician</i>
might be so corrupted (as to take away his <i>Patients</i>
life) he might effect it without the least suspition;
either by neglecting, or omitting what was necessary,
or by giving him unproper Medicines, for which he
could be accused of ignorance or errour only; besides,
if he had a mind to poyson, he as well as others,
assistants of Visitors, might do it securely enough, by
conveying into a singular Cordial, or any Medicine
made by the Shops, and often taken by the <i>Patient</i>
before with good success, a mortal dose without any
knowledg or surmise of any such horrid practice.
Add hereunto what an able <i>Chirurgeon</i> suggested,
that <i>Apothecaries</i> taking upon them the wrapping up,
and Embalming of Bodies (whereby they gain more
money then by several years practice upon them; for
their embalming amounts to very great sums) may
upon better reason be suspected of poysoning then
any other persons whatsoever conversant among the
sick, since both a particular interest and convenience
of concealing may induce them to it. Lastly, did
this Objection carry any weight in it, then neither
<i>Physicians</i>, <i>Chirurgeons</i>, <i>Apothecaries</i>, <i>Nurses</i>, nor
Friends, might administer to the sick; because all
these, as well as <i>Physicians</i>, may clandestinely poyson
their Relations. And therefore that an Objection
should be raised by such persons that have more opportunities
and advantage (in a thing never proved
to be done, because 'tis possible only) to hinder
so manifest and publick a profit as hath been proved;
appears to be very weak and absurd.
</p>

<a class="pb" name="73" id="png071"></a>

<p>
And having done with the Objections made to
others, and to my self also by some of the Company,
with whom I have conversed, who huff'd exceedingly
at my first discourse with them, but departed (seemingly
at least) well satisfied, I am sure fully and
without reply answered, and with addition of many
other Cheats besides, which I shall not here mention
for the reasons above specified: I shall here transcribe
one gratulatory Letter amongst many sent me by a
Divine well known in Physic, being very comprehensive
of most I have said, to the end the Universities
and all learned men may see what is like to become
of one of the three of their noble professions:
The words of the Letter are these.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Your design all ingenious persons approve highly,
to whom I have communicated it. 'Tis frequent
with a Master <i>Apothecary</i> that hath served but 2, or
3 years, nay some scarce one, to take Apprentices
for as little, or less time, with a little more money
then ordinarily; and presently they assume the
Title of <i>Doctors</i>, though they understand no more
then only to write to a whole-sale <i>Apothecary</i> in
your City. And truly their couzenages here in the
Country do exceed those in the City.   For I have
known 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> taken for a little Plaster of <i>Galbanum</i>,
and it is usual to make one pectoral Syrup serve
for all; as having occasion to enquire for Syrup of
Jujubs, one of them ingenuously confessed (not
knowing what Jujubs were) that he used one pectoral
Syrup for all, a little varying the colour sometimes,
and this a peculiar receipt of his own, something
differing from any in the Dispensatory.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<a class="pb" name="74" id="png072"></a>

<p>
As for their opposition also in the Country, take
this one Example. An eminent <i>Physician</i> of <i>Gloucester</i>
by reason of the <i>Apothecaries</i> Frauds, <i>&amp;c.</i>
betook himself to make his own Medicines, taking
for his Servant one that was not a Freeman of the
said City. Who in his Masters absence, and contrary
to his command, sold to an <i>Apothecary</i> a Medicine
not to be had, or at least pretended not to be had in
the Town, for a most urgent and necessary use; whereupon
the <i>Apothecaries</i> conspiring together, exhibited
a complaint to the Mayor and Court of Aldermen, requiring
of them, that the said <i>Physician</i> (who was a
Freeman, and had lately born the Office of Mayor)
might be dis-franchised. Which being not granted
them, they set the whole City into such disorder, that
they refused to attend the Mayor on a Solemn day (as
their Custom is, and are bound to do) with their Flags
from their Town-Hall to the Church, which the prudence
of the Magistrates for the present qualified.
This relation I had from the then Mayor
my Kinsman, in the presence of a <i>London Apothecary</i>.
</p>

<p>
Next as to the Lyes and Scandals of my self, I
shall take notice only of those that concern practice
(the rest being but generally false and non-sensical
revilings.) One is, that they most untruly entitle
me to have been <i>Physician</i> to the Lady <i>Anderson</i>, and
many others which I never saw or heard of; and
that I soon dispatched them. Another wherewith
they make great noise, is, of one Mr. <i>Staples</i> in <i>Covent-Garden</i>,
whom they say also I dispatched in few
days. The true relation whereof was this. An able

<a class="pb" name="75" id="png073"></a>

<i>Physician</i> of the <i>College</i> had him in hand for the <i>Jaundice</i>,
about two Months before I was called, whereupon
we consulted and writ a note to the <i>Apothecary</i>;
a week after the consultation I was sent for, and
desired to take care of him alone; he was then, besides
the <i>Jaundice</i>, troubled with continual Torments
in his Bowels, which were as hard as a Board (as
they say) his Stomach gone, his nights restless, a
vehement Cough joyned with a Hectick Fever, having
long before had an ill Habit of Body.
In this Case I found him, and in a Months time or
thereabouts, I cured his <i>Jaundice</i>, relieved his Torments,
removed the hardness of his Bowels, mitigated
his Cough, but the Hectick Fever continuing he
declined; at length another <i>Physician</i> was called in,
who can witness the truth of what was done, and upon
the whole we had good reason to think his Liver
to be Apostemated. After which consultation he
had no more of me, telling me he would rely on
Kitchin Physic, and after that I never saw him. Now
this being the only relation I have heard in this kind,
I have been the larger to recite it, that thereby the
Reader may take an estimate of their dealing with
me in the like reports. The like or worse, some of
them have said of other <i>Physicians</i>, which perhaps
hereafter shall be more fully related with all the Circumstances.
</p>

<p>
As for their malicious anger, and disadvantageous
to themselves, take this one example; I having prescribed
a Plaster for the Head, an <i>Apothecary</i> would
not make it, because prescribed by me; and I have
been informed that many of them agreed they would

<a class="pb" name="76" id="png074"></a>

make nothing for such <i>Physicians</i> as made their own
Medicines; a poor and pitiful revenge, to their own
loss and discredit.
</p>

<p>
Another Scandal is, the fewness of my Medicines.
'Tis true my Closet is not open to every bodies Eye,
nor have I so many and large Pots and Glasses, or fill'd
with as good as nothing, or the same Medicine, in several
with different Titles, neither are any of mine
guilded to make a shew with; yet I dare offer to view
with the best of their Shops, for number of good and
really useful Medicines fit to answer presently any
<i>Physicians</i> intentions, for internal remedies. And this
will be attested by some of my learned <i>Collegues</i>, who
have seen and perused them. Whereas the Shops
contain only some general Medicines, whereof few
single <i>Physicians</i> make use of one quarter in their
practice, and upon most particular cases are compell'd
to prescribe what is not readily dispensed in the Shops.
Others insinuate my seldom change of Medicines. To
which I answer, that where all circumstances are the
same, and a good success follows, I neither do, nor
will much vary, the easiest thing in the World to be
done, both to colour and tast. For such changes (necessary
to be used in Shop-practice) without manifest
reason, clog a Patients Purse and Stomach, may not
suit with the Patients Disease nor Constitution. And
doubtless every <i>Physician</i> writes at first what he conceives
most fit, and proper in the Case proposed; and
if this agrees fully to his expectation, runs some hazard
in the alteration, which he is necessitated to do
in the Shop-way, for many reasons before-mentioned.
Besides, who scruples to take the Medicinal Waters of

<a class="pb" name="77" id="png075"></a>

<i>Epsom</i>, <i>Barnet</i>, and <i>Tunbridge</i>, many weeks together?
or who refuseth a constant unalter'd Diet-Drink for
some Months, or Years together? And do not <i>Apothecaries</i>
in all Diseases of the Lungs, fly to their
pectoral decoction for all persons, and for the same person
at all times, unless perhaps with the addition of a
little <i>China</i> to it?
</p>

<p>
Some Patients of the middle rank have by these
and such like Artifices been drawn from me, but have
soon returned, being undeceived by the fulsomness,
charge, and the non-success of the Shops.
</p>

<p>
Now these things I have here published to this end
alone, that both <i>Physician</i> and <i>Patient</i> may take notice
of them; the former to neglect and slight such
poor Calumnies, and the other to avoid the inconveniencies
thence arising.
</p>

<p>
The care I had not to injure any particular person,
by naming him in my first Edition, or this (although
I had so many witnesses of credit, as appears by the
Postscript, to justifie any thing they can object against)
makes me hope they will leave off their personal animosities,
or redress their Crimes, their Vanity of
threatning me with 20000 <i>l.</i> Actions, and affrighting
my publishing this, together with my further proceedings,
by their intended assaults and batteries;
which make them appear so ridiculous, that I smile
at the first, and pardon the last; wishing them to consider
seriously how the expectation some have of what
they can say for themselves, together with the necessity
that obliges them to it (if possible) were
enough one would think, besides their many large
brags of a speedy and full answer (which they have a

<a class="pb" name="78" id="png076"></a>

long time buzzed about the Town as a present remedy
in this exigence) this I say were enough to make
any man conclude them guilty, but 'tis hoped this
Edition will either work in them an amendment, or
bury their confident presumptions, leaving no man a
belief of their innocency. If their promised answer
be any thing else but Libelling, or a Ballad without
rhime or reason, stuft with falsities and revilings, such
as was only given to Dr. <i>Coxe</i>'s Book; I shall return it
a speedy and full answer, and with an addition of
far greater Frauds and Abuses, if they therein desire
it.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
